It's with a heavy heart that I have to write this email today. Ben passed away
in his sleep early Saturday morning. 

Ben came into the fleet in 1997 after graduating from Humbolt State and sailed
his first world championship in Gillelege Denmark. This was back when they gave
the crew's weight in beer for daily prizes. I knew Ben from NHYC and we crossed
paths that year while I was touring England for the BUSA tour; Mark Ivey and I
took a detour to see what all this 505 stuff was about. Needless to say - we
caught the bug. Benny sailed with Nicky Adamson initially, and then he and I
got connected and we ended up buying 7771, the Gummy de Milo. He was a pioneer
of the initial Team Tuesday program and sailed each worlds through 2004 until
his back gave out, sailing again in 2009 I believe with Kevin Taugher. Benny
was a great teammate and a great guy and he will be sorely missed. 

There are literally countless stories and shenanigans over the years. From
standing on the bar tops in Quiberon, nearly abandoning our boat at the mouth
of shark river in Durban, Rotnest island in Perth - let's just say the entire
worlds at Perth, practicing blindfolded maneuvers off the coast of Long Beach,
buying Gummy de Milo 2 (USA 8824) and christening it in Christianhaven nearly
escaping the authorities and numerous other tales that made him who he was. 

We are saddened to have lost one of our own too soon. Please say a prayer for
his family, live healthy, do what you love and always sail fast.
