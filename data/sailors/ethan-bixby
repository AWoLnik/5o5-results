Ethan Bixby

After starting to sail 505s in Florida as a teenager, and an intercollegiate
racing career at Tufts, Ethan went on to be a sailmaker with Van Zandt, Hood,
Johnson and now North. Ethan and boatbuilder Larry Tuttle developed the now
standard North American rig in the late 70's after some near misses at the
World Championship. Ethan and Cam Lewis won the very competitive 1981 505
Worlds in San Francisco Bay. Ethan continues to support the 505 class as
a competitor, coach, and sailmaker. Ethan and Cam have won the North Americans
at least once since 1981, have been close at at least one Worlds and are now
teaming up again - in the same 505 they sailed in 1981 - to race the '98
Worlds in Hyannis. After not owning a 505 for 25 years - since he was
a teenager - (but usually managing to have access to one to race), Ethan
recently bought a used Waterat 505. Ethan and his wife Trudy live in St.
Petersburg FL, where they race Snipes occasionally as well. They have two
children.
