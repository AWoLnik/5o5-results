Peter Alarie

Peter is one of the great crews, racing in multiple classes. He seems to do
everything except steer; he judges sail trim by how the boat feels from the
wire, and calls tactics. Some of his skippers have reported that the skipper
is not allowed to look around, only to check the leech tension from time to
time.  Peter won the '93 and '94 505 North American Championships with Macy
Nelson, and was second in the NAs earlier with a different skipper. He won the
'96 East Coast Championship and was 2nd twice in the East Coast Championship.
He has won the 505 Midwinters three times with three different skippers, and
been second three more times with three other skippers.

He is also in demand in the J24, and Melges 24 - but the 505 is by far his
favorite. Peter also races Vanguard 15 with Kara and team races. His team,
"Pablo Picasso", won the Hinmann Trophy - US Sailing's National Team Racing
Championship - in '96. Peter was V-15 National Champ in 1995, and finished 2nd
in both 1993 and 1994. Peter recently swore off lead mines entirely, "I just
will not go out racing on a keelboat", are his exact words. Peter is currently
racing with top New England racer Mike Zani. They have extensively rebuilt
7318, a "high-mileage" 1981 Lindsay 505, and are consistently one of the top
East Coast 5o5 teams. Peter is a boatbuilder in Bristol Rhode Island.
