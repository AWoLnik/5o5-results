  <font size="6"><b>2001 Western Canadian 505 Championships &amp;<br>
  Classic 505 Championships<br>
  <br>
  </b></font><b>August 25-26, Kitslano Yacht Club - Vancouver, B.C.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Report</i> By Stephen Lovshin</b><b><br>
  <br>
  <i>The Trip: 4 Hours by Train, 4 Hours by Plane, and 12 hours by Mini Van -
  one way</i></b><i><br>
  <b>The Fleet: 7 Vancouver Boats, 1 Seattle Boat, 1 Oregon/Scotland Combo, and
  1 Edmonton/Ottawa Combo.<br>
  Priceless: 2 days of tight 505 racing in English Bay under sunny skies and
  breezes varying from 8 15 knots awesome!</b></i>
</div>
<p>Cynthia Des Brisay, Charles Hansen and the rest of the Fleet 1 505ers from
Vancouver hosted a fabulous two day regatta to determine two championships for
Western Canadian bragging rights.<br>
<br>
The first day produced many closely fought battles amongst the fleet. Conditions
consisted of a sunny 10-15 knots. At the front of the fleet, Hayley/Cummins,
Plumbley/Cumming, Des Brisay/Hansen, and Cragg/Cross were continuously within 10
boats lengths of each other (well maybe not that close...). Plumbley/Cumming
stood in first place following completion of Saturday s 5 races.<br>
<br>
In the classic 505 class, which was scored as a separate regatta, Saturday s
racing results had Brown/Lovshin in first, followed by Von Grey/Lofgren, the
Scottish team ex pat Sinclair/ real pat Sinclair, and Kamon/Baranszky.<br>
<br>
Sunday offered variable sailing conditions, with four races sailed in 8 - 12
knot breezes with lots of beautiful Vancouver Sun - The Real Thing! Again, the
top boats maintained close battles however, Allan/Beckler, Von Grey/Lfogren, and
Brown/Lovshin made their regatta presence known to the top boats by battling for
mark rounding honors throughout.<br>
<br>
When the final whistle was blown, Plumbley/Cumming captured a 1-point victory
over Hayley/Cummins, with Des Brisay/Hansen a few points back. Of particular
note, Plumbley regained this title, one that he had previously captured in the
80 s.<br>
<br>
In the Classic event, Brown/Lovshin held off the strong charge by the American
boats of Von Grey/Lofgren and Sinclair/Sinclair to keep the classic fleet rights
in Canada.... but move them eastward to Alberta where the boat resides.<br>
<br>
Special mention goes to Tibor Trainor and Miklos Baranskzy for the fact that
they have sailed 505s at various times since the 60 s. Keep it up gentlemen.<br>
<br>
A big &quot;Cheers&quot; goes out to Cynthia for putting together a fabulous
event. Many thanks to the regatta committee who s race course crew created and
maintained superb race courses; this includes a Thanks to the one and only Mr. T
(Van 505er) who worked on providing Saturday s race courses.<br>
<br>
<b>Canadian 505 Class Issues as Discussed:</b></p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    The Vancouver 505 fleet is competitive. This group has worked hard to raise
    the sailing level to a very respectable level. All the fleet boats use the
    same sail program, rig set up, which translates in a very competitive fleet.
    All fleets can learn from their experiences.<br>
    <br>
    A new double trailer initiative is beginning to form, with talk of
    developing dollies as well. Cooperative efforts between the Vancouver fleet
    and the U.S. Pacific Northwest Fleet are being discussed. Note: the Canadian
    Class has a double trailer subsidy program.<br>
    <br>
    There is plenty of concern, from a West Coast perspective, regarding the
    spinnaker measurement changes due to come into effect this fall. Currently,
    little has been discussed on a national level (i.e., between all Canadian
    505ers) on this point. Information regarding any new developments or
    modifications undertaken by any Canadian fleet should be disseminated
    amongst all the Canadian fleets. ( Note: A report from the Fleet four big
    chute experiment needs to be passed along to others. To be completed by me
    when I get back to eastern Canada!)<br>
    <br>
    The Canadian Championships are currently being planned. An attempt will be
    made to run the event in Squamish, B.C., which is the premier boardsailing
    destination in Western Canada. The Vancouver fleet ran a 505 regatta there
    this year, which was successful. Coordination of the 2002 Canadians will
    involve coordinating dates with the Pacific Coast Championship, which will
    possibly be sailed on the Gorge in Oregon. The idea is to have both events
    run very close to one another other to facilitate participation from out of
    town boats at each event. Both parties are awaiting decision on the dates
    for the North American Championships before any dates are set for these
    events.<br>
    <br>
    Canadian 505 sailors now have access to a new Canadian distributor of
    Proctor Spars. Transat Marine <u>(</u><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030428014837/http://www.transatmarine.com/" eudora="autourl">www.transatmarine.com</a>)
    has added an inventory of 505 parts to their product offering. John Osborne
    (1976 Olympic Gold Medal Tornado Class) runs this business and wants to
    continue to build dingy sailing in Canada. Shona and I visited his shop
    earlier this summer. While we were there, he phoned Proctor in the U.K. and
    ordered a mast, boom, sinnaker pole, and pole launcher fitting in order to
    develop the Transat Marine inventory. This should help Canadian 505 sailors
    by ensuring that they do not have to order Proctor equipment from the U.K.
    directly. He is serious about supporting dinghy sailing in Canada.<br>
    <br>
    505 interest in Alberta is still alive. Wabuman Sailing Club possesses five
    505s; Calgary is home to a couple. There may some rejuvenation of interest
    for attending Alberta 505 events as James Brown showed here at the Western
    Classic 505 Champs that he is now the guy to beat from Alberta! How about a
    regatta or training session next year? Remember the Canadians a few years
    back in 97? What a blast!<br>
    <br>
    Quantum Sails of North Vancouver supported this event with a draw prize.
    Most importantly, Davey Cross of Quantum is willing to work with interested
    505ers to modify current spinnakers to meet the larger dimension
    requirements later this fall. He obtained first hand experience with the 505
    while sailing with Phil Cragg in the races. I believe he can be contacted
    via the web at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030428014837/http://www.quantamsails.com/" eudora="autourl">www.quantamsails.com</a>
    (or something like that). Welcome Davey!
