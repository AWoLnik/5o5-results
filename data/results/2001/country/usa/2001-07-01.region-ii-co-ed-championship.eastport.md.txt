505 Region II Co-Ed Championship

Last weekend SSA held the rematch for last year's Region II Co-Ed Championship.
While the weather didn't cooperate last year, this year's event was held in
beautiful conditions.

Saturday's 1:00 harbor start was postponed shortly to ensure the sea breeze
filled in. It was the right call. At 2:30, when the first start went off there
was a 8-10 knot southerly. It was perfect full powered trapezing conditions for
everyone except yours truly (the lone beef on the wire). We were able to get in
three races, with the final one being cut short by a thunderstorm. The day
ended with Henry and Barb Amthor in the lead, followed closely by Ali Meller
and Dina Temple-Raston.

Sunday morning we pushed off the dock with a 8-10 knot Southwesterly. The
breeze managed to hold on all day and give us two great races. The RC set us up
at the mouth of the river in a shifty breeze where current, pressure and shifts
all could play a role in the race. This lead to a number of place changes in
the races, keeping things lively. The last race showed a guest appearance by
Ian Torrie when he hopped off the committee boat and into Ali's boat. Welcome
to Fleet 19, Ian!

With the end of five races, we headed back to SSA on a great chute reach, the
perfect way to end the day. Congratulations to Henry and Barb for dominating
the regatta (5 bullets!) and thanks to our AS president/babysitter for making
it possible for them to sail.

Also thanks to PROs Carl Engel and Tom Donlan and their RCs.
