Fleet 4 Championships Regatta Report
September 11-12, 1999
Nepean Sailing Club, Ottawa, ON
By David Adams

There was no question about it; this year's Fleet 4s in Ottawa was a true test
of racing in all conditions. It went from heavy wind on Saturday to light and
shifty on Sunday.  The versatility of the boat came as a surpise for two teams
new to the 505 and a "... yeah - I told you so" attitude coming from the six
other seasoned teams that competed.

Famous quotes from the newcomers:
"... when it comes to the 505, you have to account for all the extrapower."
"I believe it is a very technical boat and it could be very rewarding to learn how to make it go fast."
"... a good rush of power."


Weather Conditions:	Saturday	Sunday
Average Wind	18 knots with significant puffs over 20	1-5 knots with the fluky puffs over 10
Waves	3-4 feet	N/A

Many thanks to the Nepean Sailing Club for providing boats and Race Committee.
Ron Hughes and John Bryant also did a good deal of organizing and preparation.
The Ottawa sailors would also like to thank folks for coming from Montreal and
Kingston.  We were also inspired to see Jennifer and Peter setting an example
for the Toronto fleet.
