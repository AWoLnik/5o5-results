Pre-Spring 1999
March 27

What can I say. Saturday March 27 was a great event. It was a bit cold, in the
40s with a moderate 12-13 knots, although around midday it threatened to blow
close to 20 knots. There wasn't a soul out on the river. Except us of course.
Seven teams showed, including Nelson/Gleason, James/Romey,
Harris/Johnson/Burroughs, de la Rie/Freedman, Meller/Johnson, Price/Wade, and
Lieberman/Lieberman.

We set up a course right off the dock at WRSC using channel markers, and sailed
a (very modified) triangle windward leeward, using rabbit starts. In all, we
fired off about eight races, frostbite style. The proximity to WRSC allowed us
to switch people in and out of boats, including veterans Eric Johnson (and
friend Kathy, who whipped Ali into shape when she was on the wire), Dennis
Burroughs (who took the bus down from Atlantic City to sail) and newcomers
Craig Coltharp and Steve Wade (Kathy is also a 505 newcomer). We hope to keep
this kind of energy and participation up for the rest of the season. We hope
that those who could not make it out will do so a week from Sunday. They
include Team Breton (refinishing wood on their Lindsay), Peter Mignery, Lauren
Abramson and Tom O'Toole, as well as Bob and Betsy O Brien (Betsy had the flu),
Mark Freedman and Bob Hill. You are missed!
