Findel and Tennel are 505 European Champions

Jens Findel and Johannes Tennel of Germany are the new 505 European
champions. The European championship finished Thursday with the German
pair just where they started, leading the event from race one.

In the overall Open event ranking the USA led with Ethan Bixby and Erik
Boothe, '81 World Champions winning the final race to be three points
clear of the new European Champions, Findel and Tennel of Germany. Then
the '99 World Champion, Howard Hamlin and Andy Zinn, giving some
indication of the likely major players in the Worlds event.

They only placed tenth place on the final day but Findel and Tennel
controlled their nearst rivals, Jan Saugmann, and Morten Ramsbaek of
Denmark, the reigning World Champions, who came only 30th today, and
second in the Euros.

In third place overall in the Europeans, Britain's Ian Pinnell and Carl
Gibbon, rose by nearly ten positions after their fifth place today. For
Pinnel, a great sailor with 35 golds from global, european and national
titles, sailor of the year in 1991, this is a good result leading to the
races Saturday, when the World title will start.

'The field is perfect -- Pinnel said - and we have come to Palermo to
win the World Cup, we will try, we will be among the challengers.'

The strong American presence looks ominous for the Worlds, although
racing has been in light winds. Also placing well have been the
Australian pair Nick Davis and Mike Duffield, 11 in the Euros, and the
Irish pair Ewen Barry and Charles Dwyer in tenth place.
