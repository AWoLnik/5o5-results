St. Francis Spring Dinghy 1997

The St. Francis Spring Dinghy Regatta was held over Saturday and Sunday the 15
and 16 of March. We had a poor turnout of only 10 boats however,very tight
racing. The city front served up challenging conditions with stronger than
normal current that was changing all the time. The wind was from a typical
westerly direction on Saturday and very shifty and from the South with periods
of rain on Sunday.

Bruce Heckman and Jeff Miller got off to a good start on Saturday winning the
first two races. In race 1,Jim Waters and Ashley Tobin took second followed
by Craig Perez and Steve Smith who were sailing fast with there new Danger
Main. Race 2 was the return of "DA FAT BOYZ" Dave Shelton and Bruce Edwards,
finishing on Heckman & Miller's heels after a heated battle. In race 3 the
current had come more consistent favoring the dumb speed of Mike Martin and
Howard Hamlin who won the race over Heckman and Miller.

The stormy conditions in combination with strong current on Sunday made for
tricky sailing. Martin and Hamlin won race 4 in a tight battle with the DA FAT
BOYZ and Heckman and Miller right behind. In race 5 Heckman and Miller lead at
the first mark but Martin and Hamlin found the miracle puff on the run to open
up a 300 yard lead. It was a tight regatta going into the last race. with
Martin and Hamlin only 2 points ahead of Heckman and Miller. DA FAT BOYZ took
the early lead with Heckman and Miller and Martin and Hamlin not far behind.
On the first run Mike and Howie shredded their chute in half on the drop. On
the second run Bruce & Jeff passed Dave and Bruce for the lead. This would
give them the regatta. However sharp sailing on the final beat on the part of
Dave and Bruce allowed them to pass Bruce and Jeff,win the race. and give
Mike and Howie the regatta win. (thanks Fat Boyz).

Jamaican 470 Star Andy Gooding stepped into a 5o5 for the first time with
Steve Bartz,and had a good weekend even leading one race until sailing to the
wrong mark,OOPS. Andy Wiesner and Tom Look were sailing rebuilt 3246. It
looks stunning If you did not know better you would think it was a brand new
boat. Most improved award goes to DA FAT BOYZ Dave Shelton and Bruce Edwards
who won the last race,and finished third overall. This is a big improvement
from the Southern California mid winters where they finished last.
