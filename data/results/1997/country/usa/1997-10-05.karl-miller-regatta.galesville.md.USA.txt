Karl Miller

The Karl Miller Regatta, for 5o5s, 470 and International Canoe, was held
October 4-5 at West River Sailing Club. Karl Miller is the 6th and last
of the Region II regional championship events, and this year was the IC
Nationals.
Conditions were light both days; only four races were run. A number of
teams never made it out of the river to the race course on Sunday.

Jeff Boyd/Martin tenHove won the last three races, after being over
early in the first and recovering to 7th, to win the event. Ali Meller
with Curtis Hartmann on Saturday and Dave Stewart on Sunday were 2nd.
Lauren Abramson/Tom O'Toole were 2nd overall after two races, but could
not race on Sunday. Jim Englert/Thad Melton were also in the hunt
Saturday, but did not make it out of the river on Sunday, missing two
races.
