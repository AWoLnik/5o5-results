1997 Belgian Championship

This weekend (September 27-28) we had the Belgian Open Championship at SNEH on
the Eau d'Heure Lake. 42 boats attended the regatta, wind was very light, but
unusually high temperatures partly made up for it. We had some very nice
racing, I cannot give detailed comments on how the top crews handled the race
since I usually was to far behind to appreciate what was going on at the front
of the race (we really must improve our starts in order to feel like at some
point at least we are part of the race).

The first race was delayed an hour or so while waiting for the wind to come in,
the start was given in very light air, then suddenly the wind came in from
behind and almost all 42 boats reached the last mark together, 35 boats trying
to round the same mark at exactly the same time, this led to some trafic jam,
some shouting and a big reshuffle of the fleet.

The next race had winds in the 5 to 8 knots range and the third race was
marginal trapezing conditions.

On Sunday again the first race had to be postponed for the fog to clear and the
wind to come in. The first race was held in very light air and the second race
again with a little more wind. And that was it due to the lack of wind we had
only 5 races instead of 7.
