		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">The 1998 International 505 European Championship
    was organized by the German 505 Class Association, and held at Damp, May 9<sup>th</sup>-16<sup>th</sup>.
    Damp is almost as far north as you can get in Germany, quite close to Denmark. Damp has a 
		<img src="../pix/505_500s.jpg" align="left"
    width="100" height="68" border="0">marina full of keelboats, and 
		<img src="../pix/505_506s.jpg" align="right"
    width="100" height="73" border="0">a launching ramp. It does not have a sailing club;
    the event was hosted by the Wassersportsclub am Wittensee club, which is on a lake about
    20 minutes drive to the south, near Eckernförde. Accommodation ranging from &quot;A&quot;
    frame cabins to hotel rooms was available, so something for anyone's price range was
    available. All accomodation was in easy walking distance of the dinghy park. Damp is home
    to a major orthopedic rehabilitation center, so a large number of the people you saw
    during the short walk from the accommodations to the dinghy park, or in the restaurants,
    were on crutches or in wheelchairs...</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Damp is not a major metropolis, so we got to know
    the two restaurants, the Turkish food stand and the Damp disco, quite well. The venue
    included heated swimming pools, indoor sports complex, bowling alleys and more.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Those who expected it to be cold and windy were
    wrong, as it was sunny and warm for the entire week. One early day was lost due to too
    little wind, a second day was lost due to too much wind, and the last race was abandoned
    when the time limit ran out after the breeze had died away.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">
		<img
    src="../pix/505_504s.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="147" border="0">The new
    International Measurer, Mr. Don O'Donnell, was at the event for the first day or two,
    to oversee measurement. Boats were weighed all up, indoors.<br clear="all">
		</font></p>
		<h4><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Practice Race</font></h4>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">The practice race was sailed in a marginal trapezing
    breeze, with some nice planing reaches (and some slow broad ones too). Jens Wilke and I
    were late for the start. We slowly gained on the tail enders, only to have everyone we got
    close to, quit. We finished last.</font></p>
		<h4><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Day One</font></h4>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">There was no wind on the first day, so Race 1 was
    sailed the next day. Though almost never calm at the sailing site, the local breeze
    changed direction very frequently, with different breeze (and large calm zones) just
    offshore. The fleet never launched.</font></p>
		<h4><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Race 1 (Day Two)</font></h4>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">The first race was started in light air, with crews
    inboard. A number of teams on the left missed the weather mark when a left shift made it
    necessary to tack to port quite early to lay the mark. The marks themselves were quite
    small and impossible to see until part way down the leg. The teams on the left thought
    they were leading the race until they discovered they were a kilometer beyond the layline.
    The left shift made the first reach quite tight, which was not apparent to several of the
    leaders until they were half way down the first reach. Jeremy Robinson/Bill Masterman had
    sailed high after hoisting, and pulled into the lead ahead of those who had sailed too low
    and struggled to get back up to the gybe mark. Robinson/Masterman never looked back and
    led for the remainder of the race. Several of the teams caught overstanding to the left
    were able to grind there way through the fleet, with Howard Hamlin/Mike Martin fighting
    through to 5<sup>th</sup> (after rounding the 1st mark about 5<sup>th</sup> last), and Ian
    Pinnell/Nick Powell pulling through to 13<sup>th</sup>. Wolfgang Hunger/Holger Jess were 2<sup>nd</sup>,
    Tom Bojland/Anders Friis 3<sup>rd</sup>, Tim Boger/Philip Christiani 4<sup>th</sup>.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Every day after racing the organizers provided free
    beer and excellent sandwiches after racing. None was released until the last boat was back
    on shore. The 505 fleet resembled a swarm of locusts as they picked clean the trays of
    sandwiches and sucked the beer keg dry. The organizers also had prizes for the top teams
    in each race, and draw prizes each day of racing. Some of the prizes were really nice; I
    won a really nice Musto &quot;apres sailing&quot; jacket, as well as a baseball cap with
    one of the sponsor's logos. All competitors received Helly Hansen visors. The organizers
    had done an incredible job of lining up sponsors, including companies like SAP AG (a very
    large German software company with an international market for its R/3 product family), as
    505 marketer extrordinaire <a href="../pix/505_502.jpg">
		<img src="../pix/505_502s.jpg"
    align="left" width="100" height="148" border="1">Holger Jess</a> had sold the CEO of the
    company, Hasso Plattner, a 505 (Mr. Plattner also owns and races Morning Glory a very
    successful maxi boat), and then convinced him to support the European Championship.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">There were evening activities on every second night,
    including a terrific evening in the local swimming pool/indoor water park (everyone had a
    fabulous time, except for the lifeguards who did not enjoy the 505 sailor antics), and
    another of games in the sports center. As you might expect, the local bars and the disco
    were well utilized by competitors. <br clear="all"></font></p>
		<h4><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Race2 (Day Three)</font></h4>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">The second race was also light, with crews sitting
    inboard. The first reach was broad, and the fleet fanned out over a wide area looking for
    the mark, testing different reaching angles, and looking for puffs. Most teams had to gybe
    to get down to the leeward mark. Those sailing the low rhumb line generally lost ground to
    those who sailed the higher faster angle and gybed late. Pinnell/Powell won the race with
    Robinson/Masterman 2<sup>nd</sup>.</font></p>
		<h4><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Day Four</font></h4>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Day four was spent on shore, with too much wind to
    launch. The harbour entrance was quite narrow, between two rock breakwaters; the entrance
    must have been a little shallow, as the breaking waves in the entrance were quite
    impressive. One mistake and 505s would have been swept into the leeward breakwater (which
    had waves breaking over it). Racing was postponed for several hours, and then postponed
    until the following day.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">The Swiss team of Cedric Bart and Philip Jacot
    invited me along to check out Keil and Eckernförde. Philip and long time girlfriend - and
    top 505 helm - Caroline Stolz are getting married and moving to Phoenix Arizona (an easy
    flight from 505 regattas in California). Philip talked to Howard Hamlin about doing some
    West Coast regattas. Crews looking for drivers; Caroline will not be working in the USA
    and may have lots of time to sail and practice!</font></p>
		<h4><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Races 3 and 4 (Day Five)</font></h4>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Since the event had now lost two races, a make up
    race was scheduled for the next day. Fortunately for the many teams hoping for wind, this
    two race day had the only strong breeze of the series, at about 20 knots. The Danish team
    of Jan Saugmann/Morten Ramsbak showed some impressive speed in the breeze to win this
    race, and finish 2<sup>nd</sup> in the 2nd race of the day. Robinson/Masterman countered
    with finishes of 4,1, while Pinnell/Powell had two thirds. Stefan Bohm/Gerald Roos also
    demonstrated their prowess in the breeze with a 2,6. Wolfgang Hunger/Holger Jess were 6,4
    to stay in the hunt. I wish I could write more about these races, but we had our hands
    full and only actually raced the first...</font></p>
		<h4><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Race 5 (Day 6)</font></h4>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Race 5 started in lighter breeze which got lighter.
    A number of teams went right looking for more breeze and were rewarded with breeze and
    angle. Hunger/Jess led at the first mark, with Pinnell/Powell coming in from more to the
    left, and rounding 2<sup>nd</sup>. Robert Wisolek/Icke Schuster were 3<sup>rd</sup> at the
    mark, with Ali Meller/Rod Simpson 4<sup>th</sup>. The first reach was light and broad,
    with teams gybing to get down to the mark. Wisolek/Schuster gybed in early and found a
    light spot, allowing Meller/Simpson by into 3<sup>rd</sup> at the gybe mark. The second
    reach was quite tight due to the right shift, and most teams were forced to douse part way
    down the leg. Meller/Simpson were able to carry, and gained on the two leaders, rounding
    close behind them. The first three teams chose to go left along the shore on the 2<sup>nd</sup>
    beat, while some of the following teams took the opportunity to go out, gaining as a
    result. While the top three held their positions at the windward mark, Meller/Simpson just
    barely beat the chasing pack which included Bojland/Friis and Jacob Ernst/Jesper Ernst
    there. Almost everyone gybe set for the run, choosing to stay away from the shore, hoping
    for more breeze. While Hunger/Jess held off Pinnell/Powell for the lead, Meller/Simpson
    were able to open up a little room on the chasing pack. The lead positions held again for
    the beat, with first stretching on 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 2<sup>nd</sup> stretching on 3<sup>rd</sup>.
    The breeze was building back up, and boats were planing as they rounded the weather mark.
    The reach was still broad, and once again the fleet sailed a range of angles downwind,
    with some running at the mark, while Howard Hamlin/Mike Martin were the first to jump on
    the wire and go high for more speed. Whether or not this was paying off was not clear at
    first, but it was certainly more fun than running low at the mark, so a number of teams
    heated up their angles to counter Hamlin/Martin's move. The final reach was too tight to
    carry. Hunger/Jess led easily from Pinnell/Powell, with the light weight team of
    Meller/Simpson falling further behind on the fast two sail reach.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Up the last beat a little more right shift turned
    the top of the beat into a starboard tack close reach. Teams that tacked onto starboard at
    the leeward mark were rewarded versus those that had gone out on port at first.
    Hamlin/Martin were able to pull up to 4<sup>th</sup> and were threatening Meller/Simpson
    for 3<sup>rd</sup>, but ran out of race course before catching them. Niedik Volker/Stegan
    Heising were 5<sup>th</sup>, Tom Bojland/Anders Friis 6<sup>th</sup>, Bohm/Roos 7<sup>th</sup>.
    After an impressive string of 1,2,4,1, Robinson/Masterman faltered, finishing 9<sup>th</sup>.
    This left them first overall, but not far ahead of Pinnell/Powell with finishes of
    13,1,3,3,2, and Hunger/Jess with 2,5,6,4,1.</font></p>
		<h4><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Race 6 (day 7)</font></h4>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">This race started off looking a little like race 5,
    with the breeze dying. The right did not have an advantage over the left though, with
    teams from both sides rounding in the top of the fleet. Hunger/Jess were 1st at the mark,
    with both Robinson/Masterman and Pinnell/Powell well behind the leaders. Wisolek/Schuster
    demonstrated more light air prowess by rounding 2<sup>nd</sup>, with Cedric Bart/Philip
    Jacot 3<sup>rd</sup>, and Meller/Simpson 4<sup>th</sup>. Leading positions held to the
    gybe mark. Once again it proved difficult to find the next mark, and the leaders sailed
    too high on the second reach, while some of the pack behind realized the mistake and
    sailed low. While Hunger/Jess were able to hold the lead, Pinnell/Powell closed the gap to
    round not far behind, while other early leaders lost places to those who had sailed low.
    The fleet split up the 2<sup>nd</sup> beat in the very light air. It was a painfully long
    beat in which the breeze went far right, favouring those who had gone out on port early.
    Hunger/Jess had a large lead, with Pinnell/Powell a distant second. Event leaders
    Robinson/Masterman were 3<sup>rd</sup> last at the windward mark, in a position that would
    have dropped them at least outside the first two overall. The fleet struggled down the
    run, with the breeze getting so light that many teams dropped their spinnakers. Though the
    odd catspaw occasionally allowed some teams to gain a little distance, it became clear
    that the race would probably not be completed within the time limit, and it was abandoned
    when the time limit ran out, with the leaders just around the leeward mark with 4 legs
    remaining.</font></p>
		<h4><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Final</font></h4>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">This gave the 1998 European Championship to the team
    of Jeremy Robinson/Bill Masterman with Ian Pinnell/Nick Powell 2<sup>nd</sup> and Wolfgang
    Hunger/Holger Jess 3<sup>rd</sup>. <br>Not a bad result for the UK team, considering those were the only two UK 505 teams there!
    Hunger/Jess had been in event winning position early on in the race, so anything could
    have happened amongst the top three. Saugmann/ Ramsbak were 4<sup>th</sup>, Hamlin/ Martin
    5<sup>th</sup>, Bohm/Roos 6<sup>th</sup>, Bojland/Friis 7<sup>th</sup>, Tom Cosch/Rolf
    Meyer 8<sup>th</sup>, Fritz Schlomka/ Klaus Stammerjohann 9<sup>th</sup>, and
    Hans-Heinrich Rix/Steffen Achenbach 10<sup>th</sup>.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">A great dinner and prize presentation was put on,
    though a much quieter and more orderly event than has been the norm at recent worlds. When
    Bill Masterman finally got up to sing, it was with a small group of people&#133; they only
    sang &quot;<i>We are sailing</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>Sail on the Sloop John B</i>&quot;&#133;
    without trying any of the traditional 505 class songs (Jim and Richard Berry, where were
    you when we needed you!). The great Bill Masterman was a shadow of his former self,
    sitting quietly at the table talking about missing his daughter.</font></p>
		<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="3">Turnout at the event was well down, with 41
    registered, but only 36 racing. It appears to me that there are simply too many major
    events on the European calendar. There had been a tuneup event at Damp the previous
    weekend, the European Cup at Riva del Garda would start the Thursday after the Europeans
    finished, and the Germans had scheduled another event on Wittensee the following weekend
    (conflicting with Riva). Turnout at both the Europeans and Riva del Garda was down from
    previous years. In addition, the Worlds are open this year and a number of teams that
    might have raced the Europeans rather then the Worlds in other years have opted for the
    Worlds in Hyannis this year. Vacation being limited, this meant missing the Europeans.</font></p>
