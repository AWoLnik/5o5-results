Fifth report from Cavalaire(France), Sunday: 3rd day of races
Dramatic changes in the first positions after the last day
Winner: Philippe Boite/Jean Luc Muzellec(FRA)

The 3rd racing day started again with change of wind speed and direction.
Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN) had to start as a rabbit and controlled after the first beat the fleet, followed by Plessmann/Kurka(GER) who could not establish their position after the reaches and the 2nd beat. Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN) continued to lead with Boite/Muzellec(FRA) in second position, followed by Moller/Bojsen-Moller(DEN), Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR), Goult/Russell(GER), Scheder-Bieschin/Arvedson(GER/SWE) and Plessmann/Kurka(GER). Basically this positions were stable until the finishing beat. The commitee prepared the finishing line because of wind shifts 300-400 m right of the windward mark, which Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN) did not discover and they sailed mor or less to the direction of the windward mark. This opened Boite/Muzellec(FRA) the possibility to win the 5th race, followed by Moller/Bojsen-Moller(DEN), Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR), Scheder-Bieschin/Arvedson(GER/SWE) and Plessmann/Kurka(GER). Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN) came in on 4th position after they noticed their failure but got in the evening after a protest a DND for this race(as pathfinders they tacked to early).

The last and 6th race started again with wind changes and beside 5-6 boats all the fleet started very late on the right side of the course which was not as excellent as they thought it would be. The first and early starters had the much better positions, so the Swiss youngsters Pluss/Duerr(SUI) leaded after the first beat by 2min before Boehm/Roos(GER) who started more in the middle and Ziems/Ziems(GER) who could not establish their good positions. On the 1st reach of the leading teams the windseed in the neighborhood of the windward mark(quiet close to the beach) decreased very much that the leading Swiss team, still sailing in stronger wind, increase the distance to the next boats. After the downwind Pluss/Duerr(SUI) were leading by more than 4min before Boehm/Roos(GER). Ziems/Ziems(GER) lost their good position because of the changing conditions on the course and the leading teams of all races(who started all late) came closer to the first positions. The fight to win the EuroCup between Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR), still leading in total by 3 points, and Boite/Muzellec(FRA) was finished by breaking of Upton-Brown/Mitchell jib halyard and they must retire. Boite/Muzellec(FRA) finished on 6th position the 6th race and won the EuroCup. Winner of the last race was Pluss/Duerr(SUI), followed by Boehm/Roos(GER) 2nd, Moller/Bojsen-Moller(DEN) 3rd, Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN) 4th and Swift/Scholer(GER) on 5th.

Total results of all competitors are distributed separatly and are later available on the German 505 Web pages ( http://www.segel.de/505/ ).

Forth report from Cavalaire(France), Saturday: 2nd day of races
World Champion Mark Upton-Brown/Ian Mitchell(GBR) leading after 4 races before Philippe Boite/Jean Luc Muzellec(FRA).

The fleet left the beach for the 3rd race 30min behind schedule because of light air with changing directions. The breeze came from northwest and continued changing direction and speed(very low speed). After 9omin on the water the boats were called back home. During going back the wind speeded up to 2-3 Bft by changing direction again to south to west. So at least after more than two hours the commitee asked the sailors to go out for the 3rd start. Now the breeze built up as the day before, 4-5 Bft(14-18kn), sunny sky but very cold wind from the west.
The rabbit for the gate start of the 3rd race were Tom Swift/Martin Scholer(GER). They wre released after 3 min but continued for further 2 min sailing on starboard, direction to the beach of Cavalaire. Most of the leading teams started early and tacked later, sailing generelly mor in the middle of the beat. At the windward mark rabbit Swift/Scholer(GER) were leading, Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN) 2nd, Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR) 3rd, Ralston/Spratt(GBR) 4th. This positioning was stable for the first reach. On the second reach Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR) had the best speed and passed the downwind mark first before Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN) 2nd and Swift/Scholer(GER). The second beat was dominated by Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN), pulling first the spinnaker for the downwind. They were followed by Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR) and Swift/Scholer(GER). On the downwind most of the leading teams decided to go far right, gybe and run to the downwind mark. Just Jan Moller/Jacob Bojsen-Moller(DEN) sailed streight downwind to the mark and were leading for the 3rd beat before Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR) 2nd, Ralston/Spratt(GBR) 3rd, .... Hellmich/Meyer(GER) 5th, Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN) 6th, .... Swift/Scholer(GER) 8th. Moller/Bojsen-Moller(DEN) were leading at the beginning of the 3rd beat by 200-300m in front of Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR) and were choosing to go thru the middle again but Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR) decided to sail hard on the right side. Moller/Bojsen-Moller(DEN) did not defeat their position and were at the finishing line 200m behind Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR) seeing Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN) 3rd, Hellmich/Meyer(GER) 4th, Ralston/Spratt(GBR) 5th, pathfinder Swift/Scholer(GER) 6th, Pinell/Powell(GBR) 7th, Boite/Muzellec(FRA) 8th, Peacock/Vooght(GBR) 9th, Plessmann/Kurka(GER) 10th.

For the second race on the second day the wind blowed up to >6Bft(>24kn) and we saw the leading team of the previous race Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR) starting very late after the rabbit had sailed for 3min tacking fast to the right side of the course, Moller/Bojsen-Moller(DEN) were choosing together with a lot of other leading teams the left side where the wind was stronger but the angle to the wind direction was in the beginning not so good but after all they were leading at the windward mark, seeing Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR) on 4th, Kellner/Achterberg(GER) on 7th. After the first reach is Moller/Bojsen-Moller(DEN) still leading before Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR), Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN) 3rd and Kellner/Achterberg(GER) 4th. On the second reach Markan Ian could overtake Jan and Jacob. On the 2nd beat we saw again the same play: Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR) decided to go right, gaining a windshift of 40 degree for their advantage, while Moller/Bojsen-Moller(DEN) were choosing the left side of the beat and finished the 2nd beat as second behind Mark and Ian. Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN) still very good on 3rd place were a bit unlucky because their mainsheet broke and after repairing that on the downwind they came in at least on position ten. In the leading position were no more changes, so we saw Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR) 1st,  Moller/Bojsen-Moller(DEN) 2nd, Kellner/Achterberg(GER) 3rd, Ralston/Spratt(GBR) 4th, Boehm/Roos(GER) 5th, Betschen/Jacob(SUI) 6th, Peacock/Vooght(GBR) 7th, Pinell/Powell(GBR) 8th, Plessmann/Kurka(GER) 9th, Saugman/Ramsbaek(DEN) 10th.

This gives us now the following result after 4 races including one discard:

 1st  Mark Upton-Brown/Ian Mitchell(GBR) 26/3/1/1 (5 points)
 2nd  Philippe Boite/Jean Luc Muzellec(FRA) 1/1/8/17 (10)
 3rd  Vernon Ralston/Simon Spratt(GBR) 37/4/5/4 (13)
 4th  Jan Saugman/Morten Ramsbaek(DEN) 14/2/3/10 (15)
 5th  Joachim Hellmich/Rolf Meyer(GER) 2/DNC/4/12 (18)
 6th  Jan Moller/Jacob Bojsen-Moller(DEN) 15/DNC/2/2 (19)
 7th  David Peacock/Nigel Vooght(GBR) 28/6/9/7 (22)
 8th  Tom Swift/Martin Scholer(GER) 10/10/6/32 (26)
 9th  Ian Pinnell/Nick Powell(GBR) 19/12/7/8 (27)
10th  Diethard Freye/Cord-Henrich Lefhalm(GER) 4/DNC/11/18 (33)

I think their is completley open what the final rankings on the last day will be. We saw until now really great races in good condition and fair event with only a few protests.

Third report from Cavalaire(France), Friday: 1st day of races
We have now 99 boats registered!
Most of the top European 505 sailors are here, including the 505 World Champion from 1997 in Gilleleje(Denmark) Mark Upton-Brown/Ian Mitchell.

First start should be 1.30h pm. Actual weather one hour before start: cloudy, rainy, wind 1-2 Bft(3-4kn), temperature 14 degree C (~57 F) :-((
We are waiting on the beach until 1.15h when the commitee boats with the buoys are leaving the harbour. Slowly all 505's followed them, pitching in the big waves caused by  the storm during last night. The sky looks awful. Wind is changing directions by 150 degree. After all first gate start for the olympic triangle is successfull at 2.30h, everbody is happy to sail, but the wind goes down to less than 1 Bft and this waves....
At the end of the first beat the breeze built up and after 15 min, still on the reaches, we have 3-4 Bft(10-12 kn). On the second beat wind breezed up to 5-6 Bft(20-24 kn) and shuffled the fleet up with lots of place changes besides the leading teams. A lot of boats capsized and some jibs and main sails were destroyed. Wind direction changed more and more from south to west, that is what we call in this area the Mistral.
What happened in leading positions of the race? The first beat the Germans Markus Muehlbauer and his girl friend Angela Stenger where leading the fleet, followed by Joachim Hellmich/Rolf Meyer(Germany) and local french 'hero' Philippe Boite/Jean Luc Muzellec.
On the reaches Hellmich/Meyer could overtake Muehlbauer/Stenger with Boite/Muzellec still on third. Places did not change very much, just Boite/Muzellec could pass Muehlbauer/Stenger on the downwind. All three defeated their positions but nevertheless Boite/Muzellec won because Hellmich/Meyer thought they have to sail another triangle(their was still no finishing line, just two boats, busy to place the finishing line mark), started reaching after the windward mark and Boite/Muzellec could pass them. Hellmich/Meyer saved their second place and we saw Muehlbauer/Stenger in third follwed by Diethard Freye/Cord-Henrich Lefhalm(Germany) 4th, Marcel Pluess/Yvo Duerr(Swiss) 5th, Dietrich Scheder-Bieschin/Johan Arvedson(Germany/Sweden) 6th, Steven Nicholson/Simon J. Lake(Great Britain) 7th, Eric Petit/Richard Lefevre(France) 8th, Sebastian Doerr/Christian Doerr(Germany) 9th and Tom Swift/Martin Scholer(Germany) in 10th place.

After one hour resting on the beach the second race was started around 4.00h pm. Wind was now up to 7 Bft(>30kn), VERY gusty and VERY high waves. Around 25 boats decided not to race and at the end 50 boats crossed the finishing line.
From the beginning Boite/Muzellec were leading and won also the second race. For place 2 to 4 three teams fighted with changing positions: after the first beat  Boite/Muzellec(FRA) were leading before Upton-Brown/Mitchell(GBR), Vernon Ralston/Simon Spratt(GBR) and Jan Saugman/Morten Ramsbaek(DEN). On the first reach Saugman/Ramsbaek were very fast, passing Upton-Brown/Mitchell and Ralston/Spratt, who were also able to pass Upton-Brown/Mitchell under spinnaker. On the second reach Ralston/Spratt had problems with their spinnaker so Upton-Brown/Mitchell won back their third place. This order remained for the rest of the race with the exception, that Ralston/Spratt capsized downwind with spinnaker and finished in 4th, seeing Boite/Muzellec in 1st place, Saugman/Ramsbaek in 2nd and Upton-Brown/Mitchell 3rd.

The conclusion of the first day:
around 25-30 broken sails, 5-10 rudders, and and and ...
But all together a great day with changing and really challenging conditions!
Weather forecast in the early morning for Friday said: in the morning 4 Bft and in the afternoon decreasing to 2-3 Bft (5-8kn)! For Saturday and Sunday 7-9 Bft(30-45 kn)

As a summary of the first day we have the following ranking:

 1st  Philippe Boite/Jean Luc Muzellec(FRA) 1/1
 2nd  Jan Saugman/Morten Ramsbaek(DEN) 14/2
 3rd  Caroline Stolz/Veli Marti(SUI) 11/8
 4th  Marcel Pluess/Yvo Doerr(SUI) 5/15
 5th  Tom Swift/Martin Scholer(GER) 10/10
 6th  Joerg Thumann/Franco Weichel(GER) 12/9
 7th  Klaus Natorp/Erik Ørsted(DEN) 17/5
 8th  Dirk Filiminov/Lars Stoeckmann(GER) 16/7
 9th  Mark Upton-Brown/Ian Mitchell(GBR) 26/3
10th  Ian Pinnell/Nick Powell(GBR) 19/12

Ok, thats it for today (I know, my English is a little bit bumpy, but at least facts are counting)

Second report from Cavalaire(France)

Trainingwas on Wednesday and Thursday continued with wind between 3-5 Bft, mostly sunny, on Thursday late afternoon cloudy and less wind. A lot of our friends are still working on their boats (as we did on Monday all over the day) what most of them wanted to do in the loooooong winter days, but...........
Yesterday evening started the registrtion for the races and will continue on Friday until 12h. First start is at 1.30h! Hopefully with a gate start! Last year they started the first race with line start which had to be repeated several times. Its horrible with this high number of boats!! I don't have the exact number of starters now but my suggestion is 90 - 100 !
Weather forecast is quiet unstable so we expect rain for Saturday and maybe Mistral for Sunday. This morning (Friday) its very cloudy with moderate wind and very long waves but not very high. Thats because the night was horrible: very stormy with thunderstorms in the early morning. Ok, we'll see!
Thats for now, I'll go to the beach and try to interest some of the UK guys for writing race reports (maybe Simon!).

This is the first message from Cavalaire(France, mediterranean see)
where we will have the first European Cup 1998. This is the real start of the sailing season 1998 in Europe. Races will start on Friday with 2 races every day until Easter Sunday. A lot of sailors are coming earlier for training, so on Tuesday night we had already around fifty 505's here and we expect 40-50 more boats for the race.
The weather is a bit unstable, on the weekend we had clouds and around 18 degree Celcius(62 degree Fahrenheit), that mean that the one who controls weather has to improve his job!! Okay, on Monday it was already 20-22 degree and sun all over the day, with wind from south to west blowing with 6 Bft and above(which is approximately 25 knots or 13 m/sec) but Tuesday temperature was down to 16 with some rain and the wind up to 5 Bft. Waves are long, up to 2 m high and the water is VERY blue :-)
The first mast was broken yesterday by a German guy sticking the front of his boat into a wave. I think thats only the start of a series of damages ---> same procedure as EVERY year (in Cavalaire).

I will try to continue reporting from here and hope that I find somebody whoms datarate for typing in English is much higher than mine(may be one of our British friends!?) to write interesting race reports.

Have a nice time out there and to all Europeans: come on, pick up your boat and travel to Cavalaire!

Detlef Ihmels
