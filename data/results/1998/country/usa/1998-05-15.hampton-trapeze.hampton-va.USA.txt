Hampton Trapeze 1998

Hampton Trapze (May 16-17) was light air this year, with three races in up to
marginal trapezing ( up to 7 knots) easterly breeze on Saturday and no races on
Sunday. Since Sunday's racing was postponed on shore, the time was put to good
use discussing tuning, boathandling, tactics etc.

This was Nicholas Place's first 505 regatta since buying 8316 (a tricked out
Kevlar Parker 25, originally from the UK) from T. Brockenbrough. With veteran
505 crew Les Crane, they were able to cross the fleet on port at the start of
one race and cross them several more times on the first beat, before losing out
on the windshifts.
