505s in WA

Western Australian State Championships

Monday February 7th 2005, Author: Class Association, Location: Australasia

Yesterday was the final days yacht racing in the exciting International
505 Class Western Australian State Championships, sponsored by Grolsch
and held by Royal Freshwater Bay Yacht Club.

The fresh southerly winds provided plenty of action, with high speed
racing, 15+ capsizes, a broken boom, and a near sinking of Blondes in
Space sailed by Elise Rechichi and Tessa Parkinson-recent world 420
champions. Tessa was trapezing off the transom to keep the bow out of
the water- and they just managed to make it to shore.

19 boats competed in a new format of semi-sprint series,
windward-leeward courses, with the top 6 boats closely spaced. race
winners included Peter Chappell, Scott Olsen, and Mike Navarro. The
theory that new boats are faster was dispelled somewhat by Mike Navarro
in an 18 year old boat, winning the last two heats.

The WA State 505 Champion for 2005 was Peter Chappell and Sam Gill in
The Fish.Runners-up were Mark Stowell and Scott Bailey in Blue
Lightning, 3rd Mike Navarro and Simon Wilder in Lock Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels.

The hotly contested under 25’s division –for prize money, was won by
Julie Meehan, second Matt Totterdell, and third Elise Rechichi.

Winner of the newcomer to the class in the last 12months were schoolboys
Luke Payne and Ben Davis in Valkyrie, and the Ladies Division was won by
Renee de Voogd.
