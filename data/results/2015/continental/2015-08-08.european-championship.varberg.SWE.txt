The European Championships in Varberg was a success with 94 participating boats
and crews from 11 countries, including USA, AUS and South Africa.

After a fantastic well-organized Swedish Nationals / Nordic Championship in
Träslövsläge, the circus moved on to Varberg where this year's 505 event would
occur. Some crews chose to participate in the distance race on Monday from
Träslövsläge up to Getterön and it was a really nice sailing along the coast.
The crews took a slightly different view of the seriousness of sailing and the
atmosphere was good as always in the 505 class. Prizes were awarded to the
first three boats. On Monday and Tuesday it was measurements, checking of the
equipment by benevolent controllers that moved around among the 100 boats to
avoid the queue system as in Kiel most recently. The mast did not need to be
dismantled and therefore it was a good fit to sail the boat from the harbour in
Träslövsläge and at the same time have the trolleys transported to Getterön,
superbly organized!

At first glance, the grinding and launching ramps looked a little awkward and
there were two ramps to queue up in the usual boat park. Quickly most Swedes
found that it was good to use the grinding plant close to the sailing club
house and so we became a group of 20 boats that moved out there and made it
easier for everyone. The only problem was that it is a bit shallow so we had to
be careful with our rudder and centerboard.

So finally the races started. Grand favorites from Germany, Meike Schoemaker /
Holger Jess with a former European gold, opened with a first and sixth place
and took a lead they would not release on the entire series it would prove, an
incredibly skilled crew. Light breeze and there we felt how important it is to
get a good gatestart and it is not easy. Trying to find air from behind is very
difficult. If you miss the start, your usually best option is to tack to port
and keep as close behind boats coming on starboard. The wind deflection from
all starboard boats means that you can easily keep the height and not lose
much.

We had two races on Thursday in slightly better winds to begin with but which
later decreased, and now "the yellow danger" began to show their front feet,
Ebbe / Olle with a 6th and an 8th place. Up in the result list for their part,
was now 9th overall - fun. Other Swedes who did well were Anders Dahlén /
Magnus Nilsson who had a 7th and 13th place in the series. We had succeeded
with a 10th and Tom and Toni a 14th place and we three teams were gathered
around 30th place.

Anders / Magnus finished 33rd, we (Lars and Axel) 34th and Tom / Toni Hastenpflug 35th.
