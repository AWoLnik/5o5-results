West River Spring
April 29-30
by Jesse Falsone and Barney Harris
JESSE SAYS:
505 sailing doesn't get much better than this Sunday with sunny skies and winds at 15-25+. In spite of a low turnout, sailing was competitive and fun. If you didn't make it out this weekend, check your pulse - you might be dead. Thanks to WRSC and the Canoe fleet for putting on a great event! Jesse Falsone 505 8643

SPOT SAYS:
Jesse just about summed it up. it was a great week end with near perfect weather. the winds on sat were a little on the light side, but Sunday was huge with recorded puffs to 28 kts at Thomas Point Light. Roger Link lead a capable RC composed of IC sailors and others and ran six great races in conditions which ranged from 3 - 28 kts. Many thanks for a job well done. Results and commentary follow - all in fun.

8643 Barney Harris Jesse Falsone 2 1 4 1 1 3 12
Jesse made his final grand appearance before retiring from sailboat racing completely after his soon to be born third son makes his appearance. Barney successfully concealed the fact that this week end marked his 40th birthday - he thought he had slipped the noose, only to arrive home on Sunday to a surprise party at his house. Barney bought Bob Hill's older 505 #6717 on Sunday as a rehab project / practice boat.

8012 Henry Amthor Dough Amthor 3 2 1 3 2 2 13
Henry and Dough started out sailing well and were leading the event at the end of Saturday. Then they began making strategic errors the first of which was dragging everyone to Adams The Place for Ribs to be served overpriced cold food. Team Amthor also lost style points when they requested that the RC end the event on Sunday after only three races. They committed their final error when they failed to set their chute on the top reach of race six - the windiest of the event. Rumors erupted that they may be headed for the Hampton One Design fleet.

8722 Macy Nelson Mike Welch 1 5 5 2 3 1 17
Mike and Macy teamed up for the first time [I think] this season and posted good finishes on the second windiest day, when they used the latest prototype jib design from North/Bixby. This team has no where to go but up.

8085 Rene de la Rie Allan Freedman 4 4 2 4 5 6 25
TEAM ETIENNE forwent their normal Saturday brunch and poetry reading in order to make it to this event on time. They sailed well and just edged out Meller/Buckley for the event.

8734 Ali Meller Pascal Buckley 5 3 3 5 4 5 25
Pascal Buckley made the trek from NYC to team up with Ali in Ali's newish Rondar. While they showed excellent speed at times, their performance was erratic. In particular Ali and Pascal received special recognition for port tacking the fleet at the first weather mark on race two. Despite this, Pascal and Ali's personalities appear to complement one another. SPOT SAYS: this pair has potential.

8735 Dustin Romey Todd Lochner 6 6 6 6 6 4 34
Dustin and Todd were up and down, having just gotten into a serious 505 program this year. Dustin and Todd are in the most frustrating and fun phase of their program - going a bit slow - but making huge, tangible gains with every event. SPOT SAYS keep at it!

7876 Steve Leiberman Mike Albert 7 7 7 7 dnf 7 44
Steve continues to improve in all facets of his 505 sailing. the boat looks great after its extensive rehabilitation and the re rigging is ongoing. Steve's heavy wx performance has improved noticeably. this is great to see; the 505 can be a handful in a breeze, and the differences in speed make it frustrating. the only remedy is time in the boat. keep sailing, ask questions, practice, and race every chance you get. it will take time, but the speed will come. 505 newcomer Mike Albert appears to be fully hooked; keep eating pizza and lifting weights!

7879 Clayton James Myles Wilson dns 8 dnf dns dns dns 53
Clayton had a family emergency and was not planning on sailing - but at the last minute was able to make it after all. Myles Wilson happened to be in town looking for a crew position for Saturday. Myles has an older 505 in Canada and hopes to make it to a few events this year after doing some re rigging. 7879 had an issue with its suction bailer - and the boat kept filling up with water. This prevented them from completing all but one race.
