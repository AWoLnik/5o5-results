New England Championship
June 17-18
Falmouth Yacht Club, Falmouth, Cape Cod, MA

I expect the official New England Championship report will be coming out
soon, but here's a summary.

First off, we had excellent conditions for 2 of three sailing days (a
few of us trained on Friday). The sea breeze there really kicks, and it
blew 17-22 knots for two straight days. A front killed that off on
Sunday, but we still had decent racing (by Chesapeake standards). While
you guys were roasting in the heat and humidity around DC, those of us
that traveled basked in sunny skies and temperatures in the high 70's.

The Falmouth YC was situated right on the bay, and we launched off the
beach. Tom Hurwitch was an excellent host. Not only did he provide
housing for about 10 of us in his summer home (5 mins from the club), he
also organized the regatta, threw the party, and helped on the mark
boat. Tom had wanted to sail, but he was unable to convince anyone to
come up and help him finish rigging the new WitchCraft 505 that is hours
from its maiden voyage.

Neil Fowler won the coveted "Kivney Bowl" again with Peter Alarie on the
wire. Bill and Tim lost a tie breaker to place second. Barney and I were
a few points back in third. Macy and Mike showed good upwind speed in
the breeze to place 5th. Allan and Rene sailed well in the light air on
Sunday, taking a second in the last race to put them ahead of arch
rival, Tom Kivney to place 6th.
