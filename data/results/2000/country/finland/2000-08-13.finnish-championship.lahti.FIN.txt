505 Finnish national championship

12-13.8.2000 in Lahti

The Finnish national championships were held this year in lake
conditions in Lahti. Eleven boats were registered of which 10 showed up.
The 470 and Laser classes had also their nationals in the same regatta.
We were happy to show 10 boats at the starting line compared to the 470s
with only 6 boats. This was probably the first time in near history to
have more boats in the 505 nationals than the 470.
A lot has happened during the past year. A lot of "sleeping" boats have
now new owners and more people are interested in buying a 505. It is
very nice to get new faces to the class and the near future for the
class looks very promising.

Four races were scheduled, two on Saturday and two on Sunday. Due to
lack of wind only one race was sailed on Saturday, but luckily we
managed to sail three races on Sunday. All races were sailed in light to
moderate conditions.
