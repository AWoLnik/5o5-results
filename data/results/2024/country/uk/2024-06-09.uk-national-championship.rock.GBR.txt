Howie Hamlin and Andy Zinn of the USA bested a fleet of 25 teams
representing five countries to claim the 2024 International 505 UK
National and Open Championship title. The duo built upon their victory
last month at the North Americans in Long Beach, CA.

Hosted by the Rock Sailing and Water Ski Club on the northern shores of
Cornwall four days of racing saw 10 races in a variety of conditions.
Winds of eight to 18 knots were punctuated by challenging swell and
a postcard-perfect backdrop of the rocky English coast. The club and
town of Rock opened its arms to the sailors and warmly celebrated the
505's historic 70th anniversary.


Mike Holt/Carl Smith and Michael Sims/Carl Gibson took second and third
place, respectively. Six different teams won individual races.

Hamlin, 71, gave an incredibly heartfelt speech at the prize-giving,
thanking his crew, wife Julie, and long friendship with the class. He
highlighted a humble gratefulness to be competing into his 70s. Always
preceded by an energetic smile Howie's "youth" and experience is
certainly an inspiration for all.
