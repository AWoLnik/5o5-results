Aussie pair Nicholas and Payne are 2024 505 World Champions

The weather was once again not what the sailors would have liked.

So the decision came – no more sailing and thus the results from
Wednesday became the 2024 International 505 World Championship results.

It was tight between the top three after five races with Australians
Peter Nicholas and Luke Payne taking the title with 13 pts.

Second were the German team of Jan-Philipp Hofmann and Felix Brockerhoff
on 14 pts and third Howie Hamlin and Andy Zinn of the USA with 15 pts.

Among the first ten teams there were four from Britain, three from the
USA and one each from Australia, Germany and France.

Best mixed team was Caroline and Philippe Jacot from Switzerland among
17 mixed teams.

Best female team, and also best junior team Maike Roos and Julia
Achterberg of Germany.
