The Queenslanders had four fabulous days of sailing for the local edition of the "Not the Nationals" series.
The format was short, two lap windward-leeward races and we did 14 races over the four days.
There were lots of close mark roundings, lead changes and close finishes.
The weather was great with mostly 15 to 20 knots of breeze with a little bit of 5 knots and 25 knots to make it interesting.
Darling Point as usual provided fantastic support particularly John Campbell who managed flags, sound signals and results on the start boat, on some days single handed.
Lyn Hanlon was great shore support and there were the usual host of volunteers helping on rescue boats.
We managed to fit in a few joy rides for some visitors who dropped in to check out the club.
The Carey family win the Not the Peter Pisters Perpetual Prize for Persistent Point scoring Participants with a combination of Justin skippering with his wife Kate crewing, daughter Molly crewing another day, daughter Gemima crewing another day and Gemima skippering and Justin crewing on the last day with brother Chris as shore crew (trolley dolly)!
Nigel Lott and Bob Franks were very consitent to never finish lower than second until a breakage in the second last race to take a convincing win.
Get to the point, darling.  Sorry, get to Darling Point for the real nationals in January 2023. Darling Point Sailing Squadron
