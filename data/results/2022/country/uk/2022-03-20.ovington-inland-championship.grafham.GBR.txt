boats entered the 2022 505 Inland Championships held as part of the Ovington
regatta at Grafham Water SC. Pre-event reminiscing saw old timers regale how
over 100 boats used to enter a Grafham 505 open in the 1980s! Unfortunately
times have changed a little, but the fleet was a good mix of newcomers to the
fleet, multiple National Champions along with visitors from Ireland, Scotland
and Wales.

The first day was a lovely Spring day with wall-to-wall sunshine but a strong
20mph breeze gusting up to 28mph ready to catch out and tire those sailors who
hadn't been out over the Winter! Roger Gilbert & Ben McGrane (Hyde Sails)
started with intent - showing their winter victories at the Tiger Trophy, King
George Gallop & Draycote Dash was no luck (as if there was any doubt).

Behind them the results were up and down with more mistakes cropping up.
Winners of the final race to make their trip over from Cork (host of 2022 World
Championships) worthwhile were Alex Barry & Harry Briddon.

Day 2 was a much more relaxed affair starting with 10 mph than dropped in fits
and starts down to a glassy lake by the time the fleet drifted ashore at 1330.
Winners of the final race, putting them into second overall on tie break was
Nathan Batchelor & Sam Pascoe (Ovington boats). Third place went to a relative
newcomer to the fleet, Mike Sims, sailing with ex-World Champion crew Carl
Gibbon.
