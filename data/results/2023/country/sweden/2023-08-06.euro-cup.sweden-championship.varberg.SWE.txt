International 505 Class

Tim and Finn Böger, GER, won Euro Cup 4 in Varberg, Sweden

The water outside Varberg was totally different from the last racing
days. The wind came from land and there were hardly any waves. Three
races were scheduled and after the first, the nerve was still there. Tim
and Finn finished 7th while Fabiola and Michael Wonterghem, DEN,
finished 2nd. Thomas Berg/Johan Calvert, SWE, won the race. In the
second race, Tim and Finn showed their class and scored one more 1st
place, while Fabiola and Michael were 6th. That meant victory in the
overall standings for father and son Böger, no matter what happened in
the last race. Daughter and father Wonterghem finished second overall.
The best Swedish team was third – Peter Bökmark/Martin Persson. Thereby
they won the title Swedish Champions 2023.

It was a great regatta and proved that Varberg is a very nice place for
racing 505 and that Varbergs Yacht Club is a very competent organizer of
major events. Do not hesitate to plan for attending the 505 Worlds 2024
in Varberg, Sweden, 1 – 10 August.
