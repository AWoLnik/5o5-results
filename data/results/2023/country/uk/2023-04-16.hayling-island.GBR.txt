Hayling Island Joint Open 15-16 April

7 505s travelled to Hayling Island for a joint open meeting with
Contenders & Fireballs. The forecast for the weekend was not promising
with a dying northerly wind predicted on the Saturday and nothing on
Sunday.

Unfortunately, the forecast was spot on! The fleet launched in a 12 knot
northerly wind and had nice wire running conditions in which to trapeze
downwind to the start line. Whilst waiting for the Contenders
& Fireballs to start, the wind started dropping already, crews were
rapidly putting their masts upright looking for more power.

Race 1 started in around 8 knots with Charlie Walters & Dougal Cram
staying true to form of not sailing for 6 months but rounding first mark
equal first! Nathan Batchelor & Sam Pascoe sailing their brand new Ovi
v2 boat slipped past to win the race from Charlie & Dougal and Roger
Gilbert & Ben McGrane.  Race 2 started lighter with crews only just
trapezing upwind, with the northerly wind dropping in strength and
becoming more unstable in direction. Nathan & Sam went on to lead from
start to finish. Relative newcomers to the class David Ellis & Jim Hunt
(whoâ€™s new to the front end of the boat!) were sailing smart & fast to
finish second in the race which took them up to second overall.

Sunday dawned as per forecast with not a breath of wind. The Race
Officer canvassed the opinion of assembled sailors before wisely calling
it a day at 1100. Thanks to Hayling Island SC and the Contender
& Fireball class for having us along.
