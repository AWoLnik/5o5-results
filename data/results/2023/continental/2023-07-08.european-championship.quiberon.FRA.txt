2023 EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL RESULTS and REPORT
European Championships

Congratulations to Poland’s Agnieszka Skrzypulec and Germany’s Holger
Jess who won in convincing fashion. A great example of how woman can not
just compete but dominate in the International 5o5 Class at the highest
level.

Despite the difficulties of the occasional lack of wind, the Race Team
capably presided over 7 heats in varying light to moderate conditions.72
boats competed from all over the world including a wooden classic 505
built in 1956. The mixture of Olympic medalists, professional sailors,
weekend warriors, men, women, young and old in boats spanning nearly 70
years of history was classic 505 racing at its best.

Quiberon in Brittany is one of those must see areas of the world which
was enjoyed by partners, family members and others who came for the
holiday. Congratulations to the members of the French 5o5 Association
who organised a brilliant event.

The ever present Christophe Favreau was on hand taking photos and video
for the many, many people watching the event from afar.
