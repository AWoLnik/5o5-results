“Talking Sailing” From My Archives. 1994 505 Worlds Off Durban
by Richard Crockett

As this week is all about the first 30 years of democracy in this
country, and casting ones vote wisely on Wednesday, I felt it
appropriate to share news from the May 1994 issues. What appeared in my
search first were the 505 Worlds off Durban.

Despite a fleet of only 40 boats, the Durban Unlimited/Land Rover 505
World Championships turned out to be an excellent event, and proved that
numbers are not important, as long as there is quality in the fleet.

The top performing South Africans were Alan Franklin and Rob Hancock in
16th spot.

The overall winners were brothers Chris and Darren Nicholson of
Australia. Chris later made a name for himself in the Volvo Ocean Race
as a tough and highly prized crewman and a wiley skipper too. On the
occasions we met up during that race he always made time to chat to me
about this 1994 event which left him with fond memories of the best
dinghy sailing waters he had ever experienced, Durban and South Africa
too.
