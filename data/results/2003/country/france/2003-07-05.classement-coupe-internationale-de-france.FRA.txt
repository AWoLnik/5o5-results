505 French Nationals at La Rochelle

2nd-5th July

5 British teams made the trip to this excellent west coast resort,
enjoying 10 races in fine sailing conditions during the 4 days. Winds
varied from 8-10 knots right up to a 25-knot blaster. 50 boats attended
this well run event.

Early on it became clear that Ian Pinnell / Steve Hunt were a class
apart. The only race on the first 3 days that they didn't win was
a light-wind affair with a sizable shift on the first beat.

Due to some confusion over the number of discards, Pinnell / Hunt
believed they had won the event on Friday with a day to spare so
celebrated accordingly. However, it turned out that it was one discard
rather than two. This allowed through the top three French teams.
Laurent Hay / Jean Pierre Gallo won overall followed by Philippe
Boite/Fabrice Toupet and David Ravet / Bertrand Loyal.

Overall team GBR had a good regatta â€“ Pinnell / Hunt, though
ultimately disappointed, have put down a good marker for the 505
Worlds in a fortnight's time. Dave Peacock / John Ironmonger performed
consistently in the middle of the top 10. Less consistent results saw
Charlie Walters / Dougal Cram just one place behind at the final
reckoning.
