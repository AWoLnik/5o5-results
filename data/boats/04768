Parker 4768 Rebuild

And Now For Something Completely Different

Ed. Somehow I have been so focused on trying to turn any and every old 505
I can get my hands on (and some new 505s too) into the ultimate racing 505,
sort of the "be all that you can be" racing machine, that I may have missed
some different ideas, like a STEREO!

Greg Strickland has some different ideas on what can be done with an older
505.

I've been extensively reworking my '73 Parker (4768) for the last 6 months. It
wasn't sailed for 19 years... had a busted mast base and other rotting items.
I bought it off of Stewart Smith in Kirkland last July and sailed it twice
before the rot scared my into garaging it for repairs.

I rebuilt the mastbase out of solid oak. I reinforced and redecked the bow.
Covered the bow with epoxy impregnated marine plywood, then a funky cloth
pattern and a final urethane UV protective coat.

I added a large bow compartment hatch and stereo.

I redirected furling lines and spinnaker drain, added a stern traveler, fixed
the magic box, replaced the rotted wooden bump strip with bright yellow fire
hose as well as many other items. I have literally hundreds of shots of all of
the mods if anyone is interested. These are just a few...

More photos are available via email if someone wants detail on any given part
of the rebuild.
