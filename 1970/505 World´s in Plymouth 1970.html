    <p><b><font color="#ff0000" size="+2"><img src="/web/20050208120818im_/http://www.baaths.com/505-VM70a.jpg" width="300" height="333" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="0">505 World 
      Championships 1970</font></b></p>
    <p>Larry Marks, aided by Victor Deschamps in Muchacha V, retained the W. D. 
      and H.O. Wills 505 World Championship title at Plymouth on August 23-28. 
      They had clinched the championship by the Thursday, which was just as well 
      because they had a minor spinnaker blow-out the following day, on which 
      they finished 8th, their poorest performance of the week. <br>
      A builder Marks wins championships he doesn't drop many bricks. He travels 
      faster than anybody else because he sometimes has to, due to safety starts 
      when keeping out of trouble also means keeping out of the first ten at the 
      weather mark. <br>
      He had positions of 15, 16 and 34th at the buoy, for instance, which means 
      s sombre start in half the weeks races yet, apart from the last race. was 
      never out of the top six from 80 entrants from19 countries. His places were 
      6-4-1-3-3-8. </p>
    <p>It was not a walk-over. Swede Christer Bath could have been a close challenger 
      but for being one of a handful disqualified for jumping the start in the 
      first race (Finished 3rd. One would suspect a biased decision since the 
      soul female judge on the committee boat happened to be close related to 
      a top notch British boat&#133; &#151; <font size="-1"><i>webmasters remark</i></font>). 
      He followed this with a 3lst and 22nd, but when winds came in the second 
      half of the week he finished up with 1-4-2. <br>
      Bath wasn't the only helmsman to go well in a blow. Mike Arnold won the 
      last race and Derek Farrant the penultimate when the rigging was humming. 
      But they were not consistent enough, like Gordon Wilson and his brother 
      Philip, second overall in Freres Bear, who had a disaster in the first, 
      light-airs, race when finishing 44th then proceeded to finish 7-5-7-6-12 
      with rare steadfastness.</p>
    <p>The championship weather gave everybody a chance, though in the airyfairy 
      conditions in the early part of the week wrong choice of ends at the start 
      meant premature disaster. Courses were laid outside the breakwater, where 
      the 505s had a dummy-run in their Nationals last year, and they were laid 
      well by Robin Farrant. Two postponed starts to allow the winds to settle 
      down were particularly prophetic. <br>
      But there was little anybody could do about the first race's wind motivation, 
      a shifty southerly which enforced a 45 minute delay. Then with the modest 
      tide under them the fleet edged over for three general recalls. On the fourth 
      attempt they got away but port end bunching caught some out and over including 
      Christer Bath. Peter Bainbridge won this one in Piranha with Marc Bouet 
      of France then W. McCready of Ireland next over. <br>
      Another Irishman took his turn to shine in the second points race, Harold 
      Cudmore in Overdrawn leading home the Gadel twins Pierre and Georges from 
      France. It was another light airs race leaving the heavy weather boys champing 
      at the bit, Marks moving up eleven places for a 4th astern of the Buttigieg 
      brothers in Gunrunner. <br>
      <br>
      <b></b>In the first fresh-breeze race, Marks was the winner handsomely heading 
      borne the Dane Jan Eppers by 2 mins 10 secs. Cudmore kept in the overall 
      running with a 3rd. This third points race was postponed an hour, just right 
      for a south-easter to develop and uplift the Wilson brothers and Hugh Bourn 
      in Lord Sam 5th and 6th places, astern of Frenchman Granger-Wacquez in Sherkahn. 
      <br>
      Some belated compensation for Christer Bath came in the forth race he won 
      in the weather the Swedes had been clamouring for plenty of bluster. Another 
      Swede, Goran Kallfelt in Barabas finished second but Mike Arnold was thrashing 
      it out with them when he capsized under <b><font color="#ff0000" size="+2"><img src="/web/20050208120818im_/http://www.baaths.com/505-VM70b.jpg" width="245" height="236" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="0"></font></b>spinnaker 
      on the first frantic run. Tenth at the first buoy, Marks finished third 
      and his consistency was now revealing his overall title prospects. <br>
      <br>
      With two races to go he now required to finish reasonably high in one of 
      them to commandeer the title, which he secured with a third in the fifth 
      points race when he quite happily watched Derek Farrant in Miss 7, nowhere 
      near a spent force in international gatherings, beat Dane Steen Christensen 
      for the gun before he himself crossed the line. <br>
      Marks watchfully covered Bath who finished fourth and Gordon Wilson&acute;s 
      6th place in Freres Bear now ensured he would figure in the fight for second 
      place overall. In the last race their main danger was Cudmore who was going 
      flat out and lying seventh when he turned over at the end of the first reach 
      and limped home in the quarter of the fleet, which took s hammering from 
      a strong easterly blow. The Wilsons saw his plight and were quite content 
      to jog round, hardly bothering to use their spinnaker except park it away 
      neatly, as they almost meambled home 12th, home and runners-up. <br>
      <br>
      The Royal Plymouth Corinthian Yacht Club and the sponsors W.D. &amp; H. 
      O. Wills combined, firmly yet unobtrusively, to produce wholesomely successful 
      championship. </p>
