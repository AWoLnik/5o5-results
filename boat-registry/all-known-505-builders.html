<p>In the many years the 505 class has been in existence, a number of builders have built 505s. Boats have been home built as well. The following article attempts to list all known 505 builders and provide a brief description of their 505s. In many cases comments regarding the construction and quality of these older boats are from long time 505 sailors. I am sorry if I unfairly malign some builder’s 505s. I do not have first hand knowledge on most of these builder’s 505s, but relied on what other people told me about them.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the Rondar Raceboats section below, Ovington Boats built 505’s from the Rondar tooling for a majority of the 2000’s into 2014. At that time, the moulds had significant wear and a rebuild of the tooling was required, as new boats were beginning to have measurement issues. Rondar elected to take back their moulds and begin building their own boats again.</p>
<p>Holger Jess of Germany worked with Ovington Boats to develop a completely new 505 design. Holger had built a solid business of fitting out the Ovington Rondars and with those moulds now back at Rondar, Jess wanted to continue to work with Ovington as the source for the bare hulls for his rigging business.</p>

</h4>
<p>Parker dominated class for the late 60s, 70s and 80s. Parkers made a whole range of boats, the earlier boats had GRP hulls and sidetanks with a wooden foredeck and centreboard casing. A limited number were built with wooden side tanks. Later boats – starting around 58xx were all GRP (though a few boats with wooden foredecks were still built) and had type numbers (Type 24, Type 25). Some of the Parker boats were built with either Kevlar and/or carbon reinforcing, and several boats were built with partial honeycomb cores.</p>
<p>Parker 505s won most if not all World Championships during the ’70s and early ’80s. The North American 505 fleet at the time was built primarily on imported Parkers and Rondars. Some models and batches of Parkers were very high quality, a couple of batches of them were not.</p>

<em>Current Offering:</em>
</p>
<p>After a long hiatus from building boats, Bruce and David Parker introduced a new boat design in 2012. The protoype boat was showcased at the 2012 Worlds in La Rochelle where they solicited input from the class’s top sailors. For the first production year in 2013, they made some changes to the design based on input they received from the prototype. Boats are available in a variety of models which range from bare hull to fully rigged and ready to race.</p>

<span id="BlueBlue_505">BlueBlue 505 🇵🇱</span>
</h4>
<p>In 2013, the first 505 hull has been built in Poland by one of the leading polish boat-builders. Hull has already passed the first class measurements. Boat will be available in a few options (depends on hull material and fittings). A few highlights in regarding the hull: side-launcher (to get an additional advantage going upwind), wide spinnaker tube to fit monster spinnakers, clean design to make crew’s work more comfortable and efficient, strengthened forward bulkhead, additional bulkheads in the tanks for hull stiffness. Full carbon/epoxy version will also be available.</p>

<span id="Rondar_Raceboats_Ltd">Rondar Raceboats Ltd. 🇬🇧</span>
</h4>
<p>UK, 1960s-present (Milanes &amp; White 1982-1985). In 1982 Pete White and Phil Milanes, both 505 sailors, (of Milanes &amp; White) bought the Rondar 505 moulds and started making 505’s. In February 1985 Rondar Boats and Milanes &amp; White merged. Since July 1987 Rondar Boats has been based at Melksham in Wiltshire.</p>
<p>Rondar built different models over time, some with wooden foredecks, most all plastic. From the 1960s to 1992, Rondars were polyester. In 1992 at about 505 8300 they switched to epoxy. In 1992 or ’93 at number 8400 a new hull shape was introduced, and the same hull shape is used today (8/2003) although the interior layout has been updated a few times, with a major update in mid 2003. These boats are fully cored, epoxy construction. The KISS Rondar was a US rigging spec version built with vinylester resin rather than epoxy. When compared to the previous hull shape, the current hull shape has a sharper bow, narrower waterlines, slightly straighter rocker at station 6 and the plate case as far aft as possible. The majority of boats built since the new hull shape was introduced have been constructed using epoxy resin, bi/tri-axial cloth with carbon and Kevlar reinforcing and a closed-cell high-density foam core. These recent Rondar 505s have won most 505 World Championships since ’92. At some point in the 2000’s, Ovington Boats was contracted to build the Rondar 505’s from the latest tooling.</p>
<p>Starting around 2004, most Rondars were built using full carbon skins and foam core. At about the same time, Holger Jess (Segelsport Jess) of Germany began selling fully rigged Rondars to his specification. These Segelsport Jess rigged boats have seen a great deal of success at the World Championships and have gained favor especially among German teams. As of August 2013, the latest batch of Rondars began having measurement issues which forced a rebuild of the tooling.</p>
<p>Rondar developed and produced a new 505 design, fundamentally re-thinking the construction process to make the boat less expensive to build. As of 2016, they are still working out some issues with the design in order to make it rules compliant and light enough to rig at or below minimum weight. There are several prototypes of this new design, which still features the same hull shape as past boats. Also, Rondar will still build a boat with their previous interior layout for those who prefer that over the new design.</p>

<span id="Van_Munster">Van Munster 🇦🇺</span>
</h4>
<p>Van Munster is a recent, 1996, Australian builder. It is epoxy/carbon construction with end grain balsa sandwich in the floor. Keith Van Munster has been building foils for 505s for some years now and is a specialist in the use of laminates for boat building. I believe the hull shape was originally Kyrwood influenced, but has since been modified. More recently Van Munster has revised their hull and interior moulds and offer a honeycomb cored, all carbon prepreg model.</p>

<span id="Chippendale">Chippendale 🇬🇧</span>

<p>Believed to be the first 505 builder.  Chippendale build the Coronet, which later <a href="https://usa505.org/library/rigging-and-project-archive/sacre-cinquo-is-the-505-really-french/">inspired the design of the 505</a>.  Ten 505’s were built using new glue to glue together the wooden ply.  Mr. Chippendale did not think the glue would last over 10 years, but actually the glue still works fine today on F37, built as early as 1954.</p>
<h4>
<span id="Ballenger">Ballenger 🇺🇸</span>
</h4>
<p>Buzz Ballenger built several series of 505s in the late 1970s and early ’80s, first near Chicago, later in Santa Cruz CA. Ballenger changed their hull shape and interior details at least three times in an effort to built a faster boat. The final hull shape was influenced by both the Kyrwood and Hamlin/Waterat shapes. Ballenger sail numbers are in about the 5800 to 7400 range. Early boats were polyester and partially cored (airex). Some of these had extensive Kevlar or carbon fiber. Later boats were epoxy. 7356 is one of the last Ballenger’s built, and looks to me like a really good boat. It is fully cored, most probably with Airex, had a good interior layout, is quite stiff, and was ten pounds underweight. Ballenger was (and is) a mast rigger, so many of the boats came with Ballenger spars. The masts have bend characteristics not too dissimilar to the Proctor “D”, though they were normally black anodized.</p>
<p>In March 1999, the Ballenger 505 tooling was acquired by Witchcraft boats, an aspiring new builder in Rhode Island. Witchcraft built several boats after updating the interior tooling before they began to build boats of the Mark Lindsay Boatbuilders hull shape.</p>

<p>UK, 60s and 70s builder, woven roving layup, not very stiff, low mast step, could not handle much rig tension, not as well built as the Parkers of the era. Solid boats though. I have been told the boats have more rocker than we now like, and that the hulls tend to be heavy.</p>

<p>The Collignon 505 has an epoxy kevlar hull build in France (numbers in the range of 8200 to 8500). The shape is very close to that of a Kyrwood 505; Philippe Boite and Jean Luc Muzellec have raced Collignon hulls and won the French Championship several times as well as many other events. The hulls are very stiff and very expensive on the second hand market.</p>

<p>Hot moulded wooden construction, 50s 60s? Some of the earliest 505s were built by Fairey Marine, including all of the very first batch of 505s. Amazingly, some of these all-wooden 5o5s are still around! The photos are of 505s 8 and 21, both in very good to incredible condition. These two and two other very early Fairey Marine 505s are still sailing and occasionally racing in France. In many cases Fairey Marine built the hull shell and the tanks, foredeck, CB case etc. were finished by another builder.</p>

<span id="Fountain_Pajot">Fountain Pajot 🇫🇷</span>
</h4>
<p>The Fountaine Pajot 505 has a a polyester hull which performs really well in light wind but is not stiff enough to carry the load of our modern rig. It is no longer built, last hull numbers about 6000. The builder is still making other boats in France though.</p>
<h4>
<span id="Galetti">Galetti 🇮🇹</span>

<p>Ashord Works, Fordingbridge, Hants UK – all plastic boat built in the early ’70s. Two or three of them were shipped to North America. One of these met its end when Carl Fast took a chainsaw to it. 3xxx numbers, actually a pretty good boat for its time.</p>
<h4>
<span id="Haddleton">Haddleton 🇨🇦</span>

<p>Canada – These were built by David Haddleton in Vancouver from about 1965 to 1970, I think they produced a mark 1 mark 2, and mark 3 model. Maybe somebody in Vancouver has more information about them but David and Mike Pope were the hot sailors in Vancouver during that era.</p>

<span id="Hamlin">Hamlin 🇺🇸</span>
</h4>
<p>USA – 1977-1981. Contemporary with Larry Tuttle and Mark Lindsay building their own hull mold at Mark Lindsay Boatbuilders, and also influenced by the Kyrwoods, Howard Hamlin lofted a set of lines, and built tooling for a mostly plastic 505. The first two Hamlins raced at the 1978 North American Championship in Toronto, against the first Lindsay-hulled Lindsay. Hamlins were of monocoque construction and were fully cored. The boats were epoxy layup and initially all-glass. Cores were initially foam. Eventually, Hamlin chose to use honeycomb in place of foam, and for the last two boats, significant amounts of Kevlar. Hamlin ended boat construction in 1981. About 18 were built. Most are still racing today. The tooling eventually ended up at Waterat Sailing Equipment, which is still using the tooling today. Apart from some layup, core and structural differences, the differences between Hamlins and Waterats are that the centerboard trunk cap is slighly lower in the Waterat, and the main thwart going from the cap to the seat tanks is lower.</p>

<p>UK builder. Sailstar was the US dealer for Honnor. There is a <a href="http://hem.passagen.se/waterat/505sailstarboats.htm">Sailstar brochure on the Swedish 505 web site</a>. Some Honnor Marine 505s are in the northeast US. Very weak boat. Had large (8″ by 18″) ports (3 I believe) in the top of the tanks. Always leaked. 505 Designer John Westell worked at Honnor for awhile;<br> “Mr. Westell has played an important part in the development of fiberglass construction techniques for British ocean racing craft and is also widely known for his work on the famous Lotus racing car body.”</p>

<p>Australia – recent builder. Similar to Kyrwood shape. Vinylester resin, foam core. Ceased production in 2002. The tooling was acquired by a Swedish 505 sailor and owner of a composite parts company, Karl-Otto Strömberg, in 2003. The first Swedish-built 505 (bare hull) was on display at the 2003 World Championship in Limhamn, Sweden.</p>
<h4>
<span id="Krywood_Composites">Krywood Composites 🇦🇺</span>
</h4>
<p>Kyrwood Composites was very active building boats in Australia. Partly cored (balsa) polyester boats. Kyrwoods have won multiple 505 world championships. An exotique model with carbon fiber reinforcement was available. Kyrwood ceased production shortly after the Townsville world championship in 1996 and the tooling was eventually sold to Zegelmeyer in Germany. I do not believe that Zegelmeyer has ever produced any 505’s from the molds.</p>

<span id="Lindsay_Mark_Lindsay_Boatbuilders">Lindsay (Mark Lindsay Boatbuilders) 🇺🇸</span>
</h4>
<p>USA, 1975-1990. Mark Lindsay and Larry Tuttle and several other people at Mark Lindsay Boatbuilders built 12 wooden-finished boats using Parker shells, based on a prototype boat Larry Tuttle had built on a Butler hull shell (which Larry and Ethan Bixby won the North American championship in). These boats had spruce (later mahogany) cold moulded seat tanks, mahogany plywood foredecks and diagonal bulkheads, mahogany thwarts, centerboard trunk, transom and transom bar. Parker-hulled Lindsays won the ’79 and ’80 World Championships.<br> Mark Lindsay boatbuilders then built a plug and a mould which incorporated their ideas on optimizing hull shape – perhaps influenced by the success of the Kyrwood boats – and on hull construction. These hull shells were honeycomb cored, glass skinned and epoxy resin. Later, Lindsay went to foam cores with more Kevlar in the skins. The earliest Lindsay-hulled Lindsays kept the cold moulded seat tanks, but these were quickly upgraded to cored construction, with a thin layer of mahogany veneer on top. a Lindsay-hulled Lindsay won both the 1981 and 1982 world championships.<br> Lindsay stopped actively building 505s in 1981, but in about 1990, using a new deck mould, they built one last batch of four or five all plastic 505s. Many Lindsays are still racing, especially the latest batch of all-plastic boats.<br> The Lindsay tooling was acquired by Witchcraft boats in the mid-2000’s and then later went to Mark Angliss in Golden Colorado when Witchcraft folded.<br>

<span id="Mader">Mader 🇩🇪</span>
</h4>
<p>From Leonhard Mader: The hulls of our 505 and of all the other class boats we are producing are exclusively built with a sandwich foam core. With honeycomb as core material of the hulls we only have got problems in the past. In the underwater region where the boat is hitting the waves in heavy seas there appeared delaminations for the connection between the laminate and the bridge of the honey combs is very small. In contrast to the foam sandwich there are no problems for the laminate is pressed extensively  As well, there is no danger of condensation in the cavities.<br> The design of our hulls is from a German boat which was very successful in the 80s and 90s.<br> In contrast to the older boats, the keelson (where the maststep is placed) was lowered 15 cm in the newer boats we are building presently. The advantage is that the mast can be longer in that region and achieves a more harmonic bend in the lower region.<br> Our boat is sailed very successfully by Stefan Böhm in German and European regattas. If you will like to ask him, please don’t hesitate contacting him.</p>

<span id="Waterat_Sailing_Equipment">Waterat Sailing Equipment 🇺🇸</span>
</h4>
<p>Waterat Sailing Equipment is still in business, but is no longer building 505’s. The final batch of three boats was completed in 2012.</p>
<p>Waterat was founded by Larry Tuttle, who had previously been a partner at Mark Lindsay building 505s, and had later worked with Howard Hamlin on the Hamlin 505s. Waterat’s first three 505s were wood and wood veneer finished boats built on Hamlin hulls (the prototype for this batch of three, 7200, Larry’s own, was built on a Lindsay hull). In their use of wood, these boats resembled the Lindsays, except they had cored veneer covered foredecks unlike the plywood foredecked Lindsays, and had oak rather than mahogany veneer on the seat tanks.<br> Waterat acquired the Hamlin tooling in early 1983, and began building mostly plastic 505s. The wooden veneer finished boats were discontinued.</p>
<p>Two versions of plastic 505 were built, a glass with foam core boat, and a honeycomb cored boat with some Kevlar in the skins. Both boats were built with epoxy resin. Eventually, the foam-and-glass model was discontinued. The early foam core boats used Clark foam, while the later ones had a PVC foam core. Waterat now builds all boats with epoxy resin, glass &amp; Kevlar skins, and honeycomb core. The V2 specification is carbon fiber forward of the shroud chainplates and Kevlar aft of the aft thwart.</p>
<p>In preparation for the 2004 World Championship in Santa Cruz, CA, Trevor Baylis worked closely with Larry Tuttle to put together the most innovate 505 the class had seen in many years. The most notable feature was a offset launcher tube which allowed the boat to take advantage of the forward tack position while still having the performance benefits of the launcher. After this boat was built, Henry Amthor convinced Larry Tuttle to produce an offset launcher conversion kit for the many Lindsay, Hamlin, and Waterat bag boats that were still racing. Since 2004, the tack forward offset launcher has gained popularity, as many people see this arrangement as the best of both worlds.</p>

<h4>
<span id="Witchcraft">Witchcraft 🇺🇸</span>
</h4>
<p>Tom and Geoff Hurwitch built a few boats in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s under the builder name Witchcraft Boats. The first Witchcraft was launched in early 2000. The first few boats were built on the Ballenger tooling which was heavily modified and had an all-new interior. Witchcraft then acquired the Lindsay moulds in the mid-2000s but I am not aware of any completed boats that they constructed from those moulds. According to the <a href="http://int505.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=125">505 registry</a>, there are 4 Witchcraft 505s that have been measured; the first two are likely from the Ballenger tooling, and the last two, 8845 and 8846, have never been seen on the racecourse. Perhaps those were pulled from the Lindsay tooling?</p>

<div id="pum_popup_title_2453"> 505 Buying Guide</div>
<div>
<p>You may have heard that 505&#8217;s are some of the most well-made dinghy&#8217;s around. Many 505&#8217;s can stay competitive for an indefinite period of time when well cared for. Some older 505&#8217;s were not built as well, and may not be worth spending time and money on to get back on the race course. This page is organized in a way to help you determine which boat is right for your own 505 sailing goals. Visit the <a href="https://usa505.org/all-known-505-builders/">list of builders</a> for more information on <em>all</em> the various 505 builders throughout the years. Also, hull numbers are sequential, and are issued upon initial measurement after the boat is built. The minimum weight of a 505 (weighed with all equipment required for racing except sails) is 127.4kg or 280.9 pounds. Many boats have lead corrector weights (50% located at front of CB trunk, 50% located at rear of CB trunk) to bring the boat up to this minimum weight.</p>
<p>The used boat ads on this page are organized based on the following classification scheme:</p>
<table id="tablepress-2">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Listing Category</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Typical Price Point (USD)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Pre- 1980’s boat of uncared or partially cored construction. Typically polyester or vinyl ester resin and outdated rigging. Suitable for day sailing, beach sailing, or an occasional local race or Portsmouth Yardstick regatta.</td>
<td>$0 - $2,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>1980’s or newer boat of fully cored hull construction. Could be competitive at the local and regional level in the right hands. Usually has some major issue preventing the boat from being truly completive such as being significantly over the minimum weight. May require significant rigging work to get racing but not worth duping too much money into.</td>
<td>$2,000 - $5,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>1980’s or newer boat of epoxy resin and fully cored construction. Some older and well-cared-for Lindsays and Hamlins could also be considered a Category 3 boat. Could be competitive at the local, regional, and national level in the right hands. Typically requires some significant amount of rigging work to be competitive at the regional and national level. May not have the latest mast, foils, or sails which would set it apart from a Category 4 boat.</td>
<td>$5,000 - $9,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>1990’s or newer boat of epoxy resin and fully cored construction. Some older and well-cared-for Waterats could also be considered a Category 4 boat. Ready to race at the regional or national level with only minor rigging work or upgrades. Could be competitive at a Worlds with some work and in the right hands. Typically includes modern high-aspect ration foils, newer racing sails, and all the latest systems.</td>
<td>$9,000 - $15,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>2000’s or newer boat of epoxy resin and fully cored construction. Typically carbon fiber construction. Turn-key and ready to race at the national or international level. Includes modern high-aspect ration foils, newer racing sails, and all the latest systems.</td>
<td>$15,000+</td>
</tr>

<div id="pum_popup_title_1808"> Nomination of Jesse Falsone for 2003 Dennis Surtees Service Award</div>
<div>
<p>The Surtees Service Award was dedicated at last year&#8217;s NA&#8217;s to commemorate outstanding service to the American Section. The inaugural award was presented to Alexander Meller.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to introduce the 2003 winner of the Surtees Service Award &#8211; Jesse Falsone.</p>
<p>As all of you know, Jesse is the epitome of the &#8220;go-to guy&#8221; for our Class. When a valuable role within the American Section needs to be filled, Jesse has never been afraid to put his money where his mouth is and step up to the task.</p>
<p>In the eight years that he has been in the Class, Jesse has served as both Class Secretary/Treasurer, and President of the American Section.</p>
<p>Upon &#8220;retiring&#8221; as Class President, Jesse took on the role of Tank Talk Associate Editor, and over the past few years, no one has contributed more material to Tank Talk than Jesse.</p>
<p>Jesse is an incredibly focused competitor who has always found time to pass his knowledge along. After working for years to become one of the top 5o5 crews in North America, Jesse published a compendium on &#8220;High Performance Dingy Crewing,&#8221; utilizing both his knowledge and that of other top NA 5o5 crews. This pamphlet runs 33 pages, and is literally a textbook of how to climb the learning curve for a 5o5 crew. Any skippers out there up to the challenge?</p>
<p>Jesse has set the bar for 5o5 class members, dedicating a superhuman amount of time &amp; effort into making the American Section the solid organization that it is today.</p>
<p>Although he is taking a well-deserved break from the 5o5 and cannot be here today, let&#8217;s have a big round of applause for Jesse.</p>

<div id="pum_popup_title_1806"> Nomination of Alexander Meller for 2002 Dennis Surtees Service Award</div>
<div>
<p>I&#8217;m very proud to have commissioned this new service award bearing the name of one of our most distinguished members: Dennis Surtees&#8217;. Dennis is a legend in this class, both for his outstanding performance and for his superlative service. I&#8217;m equally proud to have Alexander Meller as the first recipient. Ali has served in so many capacities for this class, most of which many of you don&#8217;t know about or may have forgotten. Ali has been fleet captain in the US for two different fleets (maybe more in Canada?). In one of these he was largely responsible for the creation of this fleet at a new club. He served as VP of the American Section, Editor of Tank Talk, VP of international (an office created for him), and is now completing his term as President of international. As webmaster, Ali took the 505 web page and made it the most informative class page on the Internet. US Sailing used our web page as an example of what a great class web page should look like. Ali was also instrumental in introducing countless people to the 505 through personal communications and through sailing time.</p>
<p>Ali&#8217;s leadership came along at a crucial time for the 505 class. In the early 90&#8217;s we were a class teetering precariously on the seesaw of success and failure. Our numbers in the US had steadily declined, and the class lacked direction. Ali was the catalyst for our resurgence, and a large reason why we all enjoy fine competition today.</p>
<p>Simply put, nobody in the world has put more into the 505 class in the past decade than Alexander Meller.</p>
<p>Ali, on behalf of the 505 American Section, it&#8217;s my honor to present you with the Dennis Surtees Service Award for 2002.</p>

<div id="pum_popup_title_1804"> Nomination of McKinney and Cacavas for 2012 Dave Cahn Trophy</div>
<div>
<p>&#8220;I nominate Bill McKinney and Stine Cacavas for the Cahn award. Bill has been with the San Diego for over ten years, and is the guy who always spends regattas in good spirit, with lots of humor, humbleness and grace. And style. After coming in from the race course early one day in Santa Cruz, while sitting in his chair, he greeted every sailor at the ramp with a cold Corona with lime. Yes, his regatta kit includes chairs, a cooler on wheels, and a cutting board. Stine has been sailing with Bill for a few years now, and while she shares Bill&#8217;s positive attitude, she also brings a new level of competition to the team. They competed in the 2010 worlds in Denmark sailing Fever Pitch, Dave Cahn&#8217;s own Lindsay. For the 2012 worlds in France they upped their game, buying a newer Waterat. I take this as a good sign that they will continue to favor us with their company for many years to come.&#8221;</p>

<div id="pum_popup_title_1802"> Nomination of Wheeler and Mais for 2004 Dave Cahn Trophy</div>
<div>
<p>Nominated and presented by: Mike Martin</p>
<p>The Dave Chan award goes out to the individual or team that expresses sportsmanship in the unique way of 505 sailing because they love 505 sailing. The award is not necessarily for the guy that wins all the races, but the guy you would most like to have a beer with at the end of the day.</p>
<p>These guys fit that description perfectly. They both came into the 505 picture from illustrious lead mining careers. After the first day of proper breeze in a 505 they were hooked. Since then they have enjoyed attending many of the events in northern and southern California. At the end of the day they are always thrilled with whatever they experienced and learned on the water. They are always willing to lend a helping hand despite the fact that they are usually involved in some major repair project themselves. It is always a pleasure having these guys around both on and off the water and we would all have more fun if we adopted their attitude. That is why this year the Dave Cahn award should go to Brad Wheeler and Bill Mais.</p>

<div id="pum_popup_title_1800"> Nomination of Paul Von Grey for 2003 Dave Cahn Trophy</div>
<div>
<p>As most of you know, the Dave Cahn trophy was created in 1998, in memoriam of Dave Cahn, and his special brand of sportsmanship. Past winners have included Eric Willis/Wendy Herzburg, Barney Harris, Dan Merino/Bill Jenkins, Henry Amthor, and in 2002, Stuart Park.</p>
<p>Please give a big round of applause for the winner of the 2003 Dave Cahn Trophy: Paul Von Grey.</p>
<p>Paul&#8217;s nomination for this award was so excellent, that we will just read it to you:</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to Nominate Paul Von Grey of the Pacific Northwest Fleet for the Dave Cahn Trophy. Paul has virtually single-handedly (no pun intended) been the motivation for the resurgence of the 505 fleet in Washington. He has helped push attendance at regattas from an average of three boats to a recent high of 16. He regularly rounds up sailors following races to debrief on successful and unsuccessful strategies and rigging tips. He serves as the unofficial parts warehouse for most of the sailors in Washington and probably has contributed parts, time or rigging advice to a majority of boats in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia. He helped obtain a container of highly competitive boats that have raised the quality of racing dramatically. Whether you are a current 505 owner who needs to locate crew or a prospective 505 competitor who wants to go for a test ride, Paul is the guy who helps make the connection. He successfully poaches new 505 sailors from other fleets at regattas and every new sailor in the local fleet has probably been pointed to Paul as the guy to talk to about 505&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest fleet is a knowledgeable, friendly and helpful group of people and the description above could apply to every person in the fleet, however, no person embodies all of those qualities as completely as Paul.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s give another round of applause for Paul Von Grey!!</p>

<div id="pum_popup_title_1793"> Nomination of Graham Alexander for Honorary Lifetime Member</div>
<div>
<p>Nominated by Dave Stetson</p>
<p>Jesse, I wish to nominate Graham Alexander for an honorary life-membership in the class.</p>
<p>Graham first became a 5-oher around about 1967 and he has been one ever since. I know only a few on this side of the pond with that kind of longevity in the class. He has owned at least six boats, beginning with a 2XXX series boat; he currently owns two, a 45xx Rondar rigged to race with other classics, and Parker 7685. Not only has Graham been loyal to the class with his presence, he has been one of the class&#8217; most ardent recruiters here in the Midwest. Within two weeks of the day I moved to Columbus in 1985, he was in my kitchen pushing me into the fray, getting me onto the boat, and helping me to find a crew slot. He has introduced dozens of people to the boat during the 17 years I have been around to watch.</p>
<p>In addition to recruiting, Graham has been the organizer of the class in Region 3 for as long as anyone can remember. Ki Kaiser and Graham have worked together ensuring a variety of regattas and spreading the word. He was the formal Midwest coordinator for most of the years since 1970.</p>
<p>Graham has been extremely generous with his time helping people to buy boats, helping them to rig them well, and helping to repair them when they broke. He has loaned his garage, his tools and equipment, his hands, and his expertise for fiberglass work, vacuum bagging, and rigging. Each winter, he has taught Sunday-evening courses on racing rules and tactics, crewing and helming skills to groups of local sailors, including newbees and hardened veterans.</p>
<p>Graham has been one of the true fixtures in the class and he has been one of its best public-relations specialists. Through his energy and love of the boat and the class, he has kept 505s in the Midwest and has kept Fleet 17 alive at Hoover Yacht Club. He may not be the most jolly of 505 sailors because he takes his sailing very seriously. It is integral to his core as a person and his love for the class is infectious. Because of his dedication and generosity, I believe he is as close to a life member as one could come.</p>

<div id="pum_popup_title_1810"> Nomination of Howard Hamlin for 2004 Dennis Surtees Service Award</div>
<div>
<p>Nominated by: Mike Martin and Ryan Cox Presented by: Dennis Surtees</p>
<p>Most of the time when we think about an award for service to a class we think about class officers or people that have volunteered their time in a very broad manner. Howard has served this way in the past by being an international class president but that is not why he deserves this award. Everyday Howard provides service to the class on a much more personal level.</p>
<p>The services that he provides range from straightening a mast, to loaning out his coach boat out free of charge, or letting people use his tools or even his entire garage. If you don&#8217;t know how to fix something on your 505, you need a tool or a part, who is the first person that you ask?</p>
<p>His services are organizational as well. Howie is always thinking of ways to better himself and always passes what he learns on to the fleet, even if it is one boat at a time. The Long Beach fleet would simply not exist without Howie. Every year howie takes the lead in organizing our weekly practices. A few years ago Team Tuesday was 1 or 2 boats, this year we often see 7 or 8.</p>
<p>Howie has also provided a huge service to the development of the equipment that we use today. 25 years ago he built molds and long lasting Honeycomb Kevlar boats that are still competitive today. Howies funding of the blade development program resulted in production centerboards that cost every one else much less than the developmental price that he paid.</p>
<p>There is no one more valuable to our fleet than Howard. So whether or not he wins this award, next time you see him, just say &#8220;Thanks Howie&#8221;!</p>
