<h2 align="center">Competitor Profiles</h2>
Updated September 28, 1998
<p>
Top competitors at the Sea-Land 1998 International 505 North American Championship and Sea-Land 43<sup>rd</sup>International 505 World Championships include:

<h4><a name="alarie">Peter Alarie</a></h4>
Macy Nelson and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081123071542/http://www.sailing.org/int505/pix/505_32.jpg"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081123071542im_/http://www.sailing.org/int505/pix/505_32s.gif" align="left">Peter Alarie (right) at the 1995 World Championship</a>.
Peter is one of the great crews, racing in multiple classes.  He seems to do everything except steer; he judges sail trim by how the boat feels from the wire, and calls tactics.  Some of his skippers have reported that the skipper is not allowed to look around, only to check the leech tension from time to time.  
<p>
Peter won the '93 and '94 505 North American Championships with Macy Nelson, and was second in the NAs earlier with a different skipper. He won the '96 East Coast Championship and was 2nd twice in the East Coast Championship. He has  won the 505 Midwinters three times with three different skippers, and been second three more times with three other skippers.
<p>
He is also in demand in the J24, and Melges 24 - but the 505 is by far his favorite.  Peter also races Vanguard 15 with Kara and team races.  His team, "Pablo Picasso", won the Hinmann Trophy - US Sailing's National Team Racing Championship - in '96.  Peter was V-15 National Champ in 1995, and finished 2nd in both 1993 and 1994. Peter recently swore off lead mines entirely, &quot;I just will not go out racing on a keelboat&quot;, are his exact words.  Peter is currently racing with top New England racer <a href="#zani">Mike Zani</a>.  They have extensively rebuilt 7318, a &quot;high-mileage&quot; 1981 Lindsay 505, and are consistently one of the top East Coast 5o5 teams.
Peter is a boatbuilder in Bristol Rhode Island.<br clear="all"> 

<h4><a name="amthor">Henry Amthor</a></h4>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081123071542/http://www.sailing.org/int505/pix/505_277.jpg"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081123071542im_/http://www.sailing.org/int505/pix/505_277s.gif" align="left">Henry Amthor with daughter Keaton</a>
Henry started racing in Erie PA, and was a long time Fireball racer and is a past Fireball North American and US National Champion.  Henry moved to Hampton VA and got into 505s during the 80s, racing out of Hampton Yacht Club.  He has been 505 Regional  (Chesapeake Bay) Champion twice.  He is much in demand as a J24 and other leadmine helsman or tactician, and has participated in several World Championships in the US, Canada and Australia, in the 505 (preferred), Fireball, Shark 24 and J24, but has cut back to focus on the 505 in recent years.  He also won Key West Race Week Division C as tactician/helmsman, on "Defiance" in 1989.  Henry raced 505s with girlfriend - and later wife - Barb Moss Amthor, but now races with his brother Doug.  The Amthor's are renowned for their light and medium air speed, especially downwind.  The stranger seabreeze and tide get, the better they do.  Henry is the Star Wars - the Chesapeake Bay Champion of Champions - Champion for both 1996 and 1997, racing with a 505 sailors as crew.  Henry is a construction executive in Hampton VA.

<h4><a name="barker">Ian Barker</a></h4>
Ian Barker (Great Britain), the 1993 505 World Champion was a close second at the '94 World Championship, but had a disasterous 1995 Regatta, finishing well out of the top ten.  Barker and long time 505 crew <a href="#cripps">Dan Cripps</a> were 3rd at the 1996 505 Worlds. Ian is also a past Enterprise World Champion. Recently, Ian has been racing the Olympic 49er - winning the 49er UK National Championship a few days ago - with 505 sailor Simon Hiscocks as crew - but was able to have a new 505 built and shippped to Hyannis so the Barker/Cripps team could race this event.

<h4><a name="bixby">Ethan Bixby</a></h4>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081123071542/http://www.sailing.org/int505/pix/505_377.JPG"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081123071542im_/http://www.sailing.org/int505/pix/505_377s.gif" align="left">Ethan at the 1997 Hyannis pre-pre-Worlds</a>.
After starting to sail 505s in Florida as a teenager, and an intercollegiate racing career at Tufts, Ethan went on to be a sailmaker with Van Zandt, Hood, Johnson and now North.  Ethan and boatbuilder Larry Tuttle developed the now standard North American rig in the late 70's after some near misses at the World Championship.  Ethan and <a href="#lewis">Cam Lewis</a> won the very competitive 1981 505 Worlds in San Francisco Bay.  Ethan continues to support the 505 class as a competitor, coach, and sailmaker.  Ethan and Cam have won the North Americans at least once since 1981, have been close at at least one Worlds and are now teaming up again - in the same 505 they sailed in 1981 -  to race the '98 Worlds in Hyannis.  After not owning a 505 for 25 years - since he was a teenager - (but usually managing to have access to one to race), Ethan recently bought a used Waterat 505. Ethan and his wife Trudy live in St. Petersburg FL, where they race Snipes occasionally as well.  They have two children.  <br clear="all">  

<h4><a name="buffet">Marcel Buffet</a></h4>
Marcel Buffet (France) has been involved with the 505 from the earliest days of the class.  Racing against Paul Elvstrom and other famous sailors, he won the 1959 and 1960 World Championships.
<p>
Committed to the 505, he has raced in almost every 505 Worlds ever held, only missing a few while doing an Olympic Campaign in the Flying Dutchman.  He raced the heavy air 1992 Santa Cruz 505 Worlds at 71 years of age, raced in the 1995 Mounts Bay Worlds, finishing 24rd, and the 1996 Worlds in Townsville Australia, where he was 10th in the last race.  After some strong performances in the 1997 World Championship and good finishes in some of the 1998 5o5 European Cup events, Buffet is looking forward to his 38<sup>th</sup> (or is it 40<sup>th</sup>?) 505 World Championship.<br clear="all">

<h4><a name="collins">Tim Collins</a></h4>
Tim Collins was a top intercollegiate racer and all American.  He raced 470s, competing at Olympic trials and winning the 470 North American Championship.  He sold the 470s and bought a used 505 with Bill Smith in 1996.  They traded up to a newer 505 in 1997.  Tim races with <a href="#bsmith">Bill Smith</a>. Tim lives in Rhode Island.  Tim and Bill have been training hard for the World Championship, and recently won the 505 East Coast Championship, over a star studded field.

<h4><a name="cripps">Daniel Cripps</a></h4>
Racing with <a href="#barker">Ian Barker</a>, The 1993 505 World Champion, Dan Cripps (Great Britain) was a close second at the '94 World Championship, had a disasterous 1995 Regatta, finishing well out of the top ten, but bounced back in 1996 with a 3rd.  Ian has been racing the Olympic 49er - recently winning the UK 49er championship - but was able to have a new 505 built and shippped to Hyannis for this event.

<h4><a name="falsone">Jesse Falsone</a></h4>
Jesse sailed keel boats much of his life before realizing that dinghy sailing is more fun and challenging, especially in a 505.  Jesse was the captain of the Offshore Sailing Team at NY Maritime College (class of '91) and went on from there to campaign IMS boats.  In 1995, he bought and refurbished an old InterClub and resurrected the Annapolis InterClub Fleet.  Macy Nelson recruited Jesse to sail 505's in 1996.  Since then, Jesse has been campaigning a 505 with <a href="#harris">Barney Harris</a> in 7772 and now 8643, a new Waterat.  Jesse is a naval architect with Advanced Marine Enterprises, Inc. in Arlington VA, he lives in Annapolis MD with his family.

<h4><a name="fry">John Fry</a></h4>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081123071542im_/http://www.sailing.org/int505/pix/505a06s.gif" align="left">John relaxing in the boat while sailing in after a '95 pre-worlds race. John was a crew in the 1982 Worlds, and a crew in the 1995 Worlds, and many 505 worlds in between.  Many of those 505 World Championships were with Macy Nelson.  John has also raced with Ali Meller, Tom Kivney and others.  Once upon a time he sailed Solings with Stu Walker.  John sailed Snipes with his wife for awhile; his son Matthew is still a little young for the 505.  John is racing the World Championship with Australian Ian Dunn.  John and his family recently moved to Seattle WA from Tuxedo Park NY.<br clear="all">

<h4><a name="hamlin">Howard Hamlin</a></h4>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081123071542/http://www.sailing.org/int505/pix/505_21.gif"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081123071542im_/http://www.sailing.org/int505/pix/505_21s.gif" align="left">Mike Martin and Howard Hamlin (head in boat) preparing <i>Spaceman Spiff</i></a>.
After years of surfing and believing that sailboats were slow and boring, Howard was given a ride in a 505, and discovered how wrong his earlier beliefs were.  Despite no prior sailing experience, Howard immediately decided that racing 505s was for him, and he quickly became one of the best crews on the West Coast.  Howard then decided to build a better 505, and he built a set of tooling and started building the very innovative Hamlin 505 (after Howard stopped building boats, Waterat began building boats from the same tooling).  After several years of crewing for John Andron, and some narrow misses at the 505 World Championship, Howard started steering.  He raced with Jay Glaser on the wire for several years, with numerous top finishes.  More recently, Howard has been racing with Don Smith, Cam Lewis, and Mike Martin.  Howard and Cam won the heavy air pre-worlds event in '92 and were favorites to win the Worlds 
until Cam was injured and forced out of the regatta.  Howard and <a href="#martin">Mike Martin</a> narrowly missed winning the '94 European Championship, and the '95 North American championship.  Howard and Cam Lewis narrowly missed winning the 1996 International 505 World Championship in Townsville Australia.  Later, Howard and Mike won the 1996 5o5 North American Championship, the third time Howard won the NAs.  They were second at the 1997 NAs and 3rd at the 1997 World Championship.  After several years of boatbuilding - his Hamlin tooling is still used to build the Waterat 505 - Howard decided not to be poor, and now is in real estate.  Howard lives in the LA area, CA.<br clear="all">

<h4><a name="harris">Barney Harris</a></h4>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081123071542im_/http://www.sailing.org/int505/pix/505_11s.gif" align="left">Barney Harris after narrowly missing a capsize.
Barney Harris raced intercollegiate at the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, NY. While he was there, they were in the top 3 nationally, winning nationals twice. After graduating he raced Albacores for years in he Washington DC area, he still races the Albacore. He won the '94, '95, and '96  Albacore US Nationals, and was second at the '96 Canadian Nationals.  He has several top five finishes at Albacore World Championsips. He has also raced Snipes, Thistles, Highlander, Laser, J22, J24, Melges 24, Etchells, Sheilds, Ensign, El Torro and - he claims - anything else that floats.  Barney borrowed a 505 a couple of times over the past two years, and bought a used 505 in 1995. A few weeks later he was racing it for the first time at CORK. Barney bought a new Waterat 505 in the spring of 1997 and is  campaigning it with local crew, ex IMS leadmine sailor and current Interclub frosbite ace, <a href="#falsone">Jesse Falsone</a>. Barney is an engineer with a consulting company in the DC area.   He lives in Arlington VA, and sails out of West River Sailing Club, in Galesville MD.
<br clear="all"> 


<h4><a name="ikle">Scott Ikle</a></h4>
Scott is another convert from leadmines.  Apparently while part of  a full-on big boat racing program, Scott and Mike Punnet saw a 505 plane by and decided they had to get one.  Several years later, after buying a new Waterat and developing their downwind technique to something close to awesome, Mike and Scott were the hottest 505 team on the East Coast.  Apart from multiple East Coast Championship wins, Scott and Mike also had several top five finishes at 505 World Championships.  Scott now races with <a href="#moore">Tyler Moore</a>.  Scott/Tyler were 2nd at the 1996 505 North American Championship, and 2nd at the 1997 505 East Coast Championship.  Scott is the sailing coach at Hobart William Smith college in upstate NY.  He was awarded the US Sailing Developmental Coach of the year award in September of 1998.


<h4><a name="lewis">Cam Lewis</a></h4>
505 World Champion 1981 and 1982; Finn Gold Cup and US Olympic Finn Trials 1980; crew on the first boat to win the Jules Verne trophy for going around the world in under 80 days; competitor in the One Design 14 professional circuit; Cam Lewis has sailed them all.  Cam makes his living sailing; the only boat he races for free is the 505.  As do many other  crews, Cam owns the boat and looks for good drivers.   Crews are as important, if not more important, than helms in 505s. He got Ethan Bixby around the course fast enough to win the '81 Worlds, and Gary Knapp around fast enough to win in '82.  He and Ethan or Howard Hamlin have had several near misses since, including narrowly missing winning the 1996 505 World Championship. Cam pulled his 18 year old 505 out of the barn, and hooked up with <a href="#bixby">Ethan Bixby</a> for the '98 Worlds. Cam and his family live in Maine.<br clear="all">
