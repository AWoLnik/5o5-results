Jesse Falsone

Jesse sailed keel boats much of his life before realizing that dinghy sailing
is more fun and challenging, especially in a 505. Jesse was the captain of the
Offshore Sailing Team at NY Maritime College (class of '91) and went on from
there to campaign IMS boats. In 1995, he bought and refurbished an old
InterClub and resurrected the Annapolis InterClub Fleet. Macy Nelson recruited
Jesse to sail 505's in 1996. Since then, Jesse has been campaigning a 505 with
Barney Harris in 7772 and now 8643, a new Waterat. Jesse is a naval architect
with Advanced Marine Enterprises, Inc. in Arlington VA, he lives in Annapolis
MD with his family.
