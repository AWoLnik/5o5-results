Marcel Buffet

Marcel Buffet (France) has been involved with the 505 from the earliest days
of the class. Racing against Paul Elvstrom and other famous sailors, he won
the 1959 and 1960 World Championships.

Committed to the 505, he has raced in almost every 505 Worlds ever held, only
missing a few while doing an Olympic Campaign in the Flying Dutchman. He raced
the heavy air 1992 Santa Cruz 505 Worlds at 71 years of age, raced in the 1995
Mounts Bay Worlds, finishing 24rd, and the 1996 Worlds in Townsville
Australia, where he was 10th in the last race. After some strong performances
in the 1997 World Championship and good finishes in some of the 1998 5o5
European Cup events, Buffet is looking forward to his 38th (or is it 40th?)
505 World Championship.
