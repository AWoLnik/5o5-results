Ian Barker

Ian Barker (Great Britain), the 1993 505 World Champion was a close second at
the '94 World Championship, but had a disasterous 1995 Regatta, finishing well
out of the top ten. Barker and long time 505 crew Dan Cripps were 3rd at the
1996 505 Worlds. Ian is also a past Enterprise World Champion. Recently, Ian
has been racing the Olympic 49er - winning the 49er UK National Championship
a few days ago - with 505 sailor Simon Hiscocks as crew - but was able to have
a new 505 built and shippped to Hyannis so the Barker/Cripps team could race
this event.
