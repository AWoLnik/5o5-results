Gosford Easter Regatta 1999

Easter time is renowned for its wet weather and this year was exactly
that. At least both days we had wind, Saturday 5 to 8 knots from the SE
and Sunday 8 to 12 knots from the east. It was great to see Leigh Winter
and Tony Outteridge come out of retirement and win the regatta. It would
be great to see this combination back on a permanent basis.
