Burton Open
Burton SC, 22nd / 23rd May

Strong breezes gave 26 505s a good workout at Burton SC on 22/23 May.
Stuart Turnbull/Jason Lunn looked good in race one, but honours went to
Clive Robinson/Gary Cawthorne, followed by Tim Bird/Arthur George.
Richard Tew/John Ironmonger made a nice job of race two, with Mark
Upton-Brown/Ian Mitchell getting to grips with the lake, and Clive
third.

When Mark scored two more wins and a third on Sunday the business was
done. Clive got a 2 and 3, whilst Richard scored a 3 and a 4. Martin
Goult/Dan Johnson got things sorted on Sunday with a win and a 2, with
Richard Sims/Simon Wood trying the new sails to claim a 2. Good race
organisation by Brian & Joan Johnson, excellent home-cooked food and
some local brew, all made a sound weekend.

Burton is currently a leading 505 club, where visitors are welcome to
join the racing through the year.
