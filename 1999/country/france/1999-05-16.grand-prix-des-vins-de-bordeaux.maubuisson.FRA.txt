Grand Prix des Vins de Bordeaux
Maubuisson - 13th to 16th May 1999

32 505 went to Maubuisson in the Bordeaux area to race the annual "Grand Prix
des Vins de Bordeaux"... at prize giving, each team gets 6 bottles of famous
Medoc from chateau Arnaud... hence the participation. 10 races were raced over
4 days in light winds oscillating, pulsing and shifty... usual at this time of
the year on this beautiful lake close to the seashore in the South West of
France.

Philippe Boite won overall with 7 first, one second and 2 OCS The young team
Gallo Toupet finished second overall despite two mediocre first days. Third
Michel Christ getting there with former Ian Pinnell Rondar boat Laurent Hay did
a wonderful regatta and could have finished second overall more luck OCS in the
fifth race was a killer.

The two first boats are similar, Duvoisin, Proctor D, Pinnell and Bax sails and
Duvoisin foils. The two following are similar as well, Rondar, Proctor D,
Pinnell and Bax sails and Milanes foils.

Pierre Soulier finished seventh, Pierre sold his Kyrwood six months ago and he
is helming an Mader boat. Pierre is getting there and race after race he is
improving the boat and team work.... and he will soon be at the top of the
fleet... What about Marcel ? He stayed home to look after Huguette still under
heavy care at the hospital in Paris.

For the first time in France, the club sent the result on the net to the class
direct... avoiding us to chase the copy of the sheet... Congratulations to a
club who understands the use we can all do of such a great tool... thanks to
Claude Richard the president.


Best regards
Jean-Baptiste
