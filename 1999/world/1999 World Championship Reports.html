        <h1>1999 505 World Championship Regatta Reports from the Field</h1>
        <h2><a name="jul10">July 10, 1999 - Quiberon, France</a></h2>
        <p><i>Alarm clock, what's that?</i>
        <p>We had to get up pretty early this morning for the race was called at 7:50am an hour away from the beach but it was worth it since the sun rises with great colours and the wind was steadily blowing 12 knots with somewhat choppy conditions.... a few crews had a pretty hard wake up since one of them forgot to hook before going out on the wire and a few boats capsized on the way to the starting line.
        <p>Howard Hamlin did not race since he had won the championship. Andy Beeckman and Ben Benjamin were nervous to maintain their second overall.  But Mark Upton Brown who had not sailed as well as he is used to enjoyed
        the early morning breeze and won that race with an impressive speed going upwind.  The race was fun and fast given the conditions we experienced this morning. As soon as we got back to the beach we packed our boat and get
        clean and ready for the prizegiving ceremony...
        <p>Many thanks to all the participants and the people who had made possible the 99 regatta.  Some very moving words to Huguette from everyone and in particular from Mark Upton Brown.  Our President Pip Pearson made a nice talk and we all rushed to the buffet after having heard all the best about the next World Championship organization in Durban next year.
        <p>Overall a great event raced in very light conditions except the very last race and a great winner with Howard Hamlin and his crew Mike Martin.  Howard had some nice words to his boat builders, his wife and his faithful crew and team mates in Long Beach, California. He was obviously genuinely happy for this great achievement.  This event will remain as the largest turnout at a World in the 5o5 history which has resulted in spectacular races.
        <p>Congratulations to the winners and to all the participants.
        <p>Best regards
        <br>Jean-Baptiste
        <br>P.S. See you all in Durban

        <p><i>It's never like this here.</i>
        <p>Wind died at the time of the race leaving the 156 competitors very frustrated...the 157th was mumbling that this was "so great" sitting at the bar and contemplating their competitors drying out and sipping beer waiting for the breeze to settle in vain...
        <p>Howard Hamlin and Mike Martin's chances to win the championship increased tremendeously today since he leads the championship with seven points.  The race committee informed us that race 5 (the only left to be raced) will start very early (7:50a.m. on the water, an hour away from the launching beach).
        <p>Cheers

        <p><i>From the ISAF webserver...</i>
        <p>  L'Ecole National de Voile -- the French National Sailing School -- provides an incredible venue for this 505 World Championship, with plenty of room to park the 505s on shore, a fleet of RC vessels, an outstanding Race Committee, and a gorgeous beach to swim from, and launch the 505s from. The French Olympic sailing team trains at this venue. The race courses are within Quiberon Bay, a large body of water on the south coast of Brittany, formed by the fishhook shape of the Quiberon peninsula. With local sea breezes, coastal see breezes, weather systems and complex tides, racing is  extremely challenging; winning a race takes not only an excellent start and very good speed around the course, but a detailed understanding of the day's conditions. Great sailing is not the only attraction of the venue, as Quiberon and nearby St. Pierre Quiberon have more restaurants and bars than the competitors can hope to sample in the two weeks we are spending in this wonderful corner of the world. For those whose intersts extend beyond sailing, eating and drinking with friends, nearby Carnac is the site of a an incredible stone alignment much larger than Stonehenge and thought to  be about the same age. 
        <p>In a 157 505 fleet, there are a number of competitors who are sailing their first 505 world championship, but the talent in the fleet goes very deep, with Olympic medalists, multiple world champions in the 505 as well as Flying Dutchman, 470, Soling and other classes, America's Cup sailors and many national and regional champions in the 505 and other classes. The video of the mark roundings shows incredibly close racing, with every inch and every finish position keenly contested around the race course. Some finishes have had much of the fleet finishing virtually overlapped, after 18 nautical mile races; the RC finish horn can be heard sounding at less than one second intervals. A simple mistake such as missing a shift can easily cost 30 boats.

        <p><i>Where's the breeze?</i>
        <p><i>From the ISAF webserver...</i>
        <br>Despite the Race Committee's best efforts, no race could be run Thursday due to light and variable winds, so we remain at four races completed, and are now expecting a six -- rather than seven -- race series. Long Beach, USA, sailors Howard Hamlin and Mike Martin, who have been finished in the top positions at 505 World Championships many times, but have never won a 505 world championship, lead the standings with a first and three seconds.  Another Long Beach team of Andy Beckman and Ben Benjamin hold down second place overall with two firsts a fifth and a ninth.  In third overall are 1990 505 World Champions Jorgen Schonherr and Anders Kaempe of Denmark. Multiple time 470 World Champion Wolfgang Hunger sailing with Holger Jess, from Germany, are in fourth overall, while four time 505 World Champion Krister Bergstrom with Thomas Moss from Sweden are in fifth.
        <p>With 157 505s racing, this is believed to be the largest 505 World Championship held in the 505 class's forty four year history.  Due to the 505 class's use of gate starts, there have been no recalls, and each of the four gate starts so far was successful.  The 505 class recently chose to make the 505 World Championship open, and this has attracted a number of newcomers into the 505. "There are more French 505 sailors here than we have had at a French National Championship for many years", said World organizer Jean-Baptiste Dupont.  "The open worlds is the reason many of them have joined the 505 class."  ISAF President Paul Henderson was in the gate launch for the start of races two and three, a perfect location to see the excitement, close starting and tactics of a gate start.

        <p><i>Mike and Howie keep on rolling</i>
        <p>Our competitors were very surprised with the level of control put forward by the French organizers (not the French class by the way).  Yesterday one competitor had his boat controlled and reweight this
        morning under the threat to be excluded... luckily the boat was allright and the race results were OK. Today 5 guys had to comply with the anti-doping controls... just as the tour de France cyclists.... three boats failed the black band check (main sail over mast black band)...
        <p>Howard Hamlin won race 4  brillantly taking the lead from Andy Beeckman still too inconsistant  to win the trophy despite a great talent he demonstrated in the former races and in leading the fleet after the first beat today.  Krister Bergstroem finished second and Shoenherr third in his wonderfull
        and flashy brand new Rondar very well fitted out.
        <p>The weather was pretty much the same as yesterday with a high over the area bringing a typical thermal breeze in the afternoon making the race fun to race and very spectacular in a force 3 to 4 breeze.  Pip Pearson chaired the annual AGM were several topics were discussed such as the big spinnaker trials, the next coming World championships in Durban, Portugal , Fremantle, and Sweden (full minutes will be distributed later on).  About 12 protests were lodged today and will be investigated tomorrow morning so the results published  below are still provisional.
        <p>Cheers
        <br>Jean-Baptiste
        <h2><a name="jul6">July 6, 1999 - Quiberon, France</a></h2>
        <p><i>Where the hell is Long Beach?</i>
        <p>The Californian squad from Long Beach conforted their lead on the championship making one and two at the third race today.  Weather was misty in the morning clearing up with wind changing in strength and direction until the sea breeze settled and blew force 4 in the end of the afternoon making this race fun and spectacular. (150+ boats on a tight reach with some spectacular fights to stay on the
        line... wow!!!)
        <p>The place is very complex to sail and only the very top sailors manage to work it out. It is a very selective race area and any minor mistake results in a dramatic drop in the ranking... Ali who made a wonderful start for instance got trapped by the shift of up to 15 degrees biaising the line tremendeously.. forcing him to bear away in the shifting wind to reach the mark together with all the early starters.
        <p>The Californian Andy Beeckman and his crew Ben Benjamin were the fastest in these conditions followed by Howard Hamlin in good position to win the championship... After three races only a few blokes can now pretend to win the trophy and given the wind conditions are going to be light all the way long, according to the met office , the big guys are not lilkely to make it for their more than average results so far.  The fast American rigs (in light and medium air) with their long and thin foils may well pave the way to improve the boat a bit more eventhough this new way of sailing forces the crew to watch for seaweed caught in the foils constantly during the race.... The point is that they are damn fast at the moment...
        <p>Marcel Buffet in his late 70ties, rounded the windward mark 25th and managed to finished 41st, proving that age does not matter as long as the talent is there... Marcel has just found a new rig set up and he is working it out better and better everyday.
        <p>It was "Caribean soiree" tonight at the venue with a killer punch who almost made it impossible to send out today's report... but I made it safe to the computer,... luckily , but hard though.  10 protests were lodged today but half of them were lodged by the jury itself... with only two disqualifications.
        <p>Cheers
        <br>Jean-Baptiste
        <br>PS: we are having so much fun... and we still miss you all
        <h2><a name="jul5">July 5, 1999 - Quiberon, France</a></h2>
        <p><i>The British strike back.</i>
        <p>Unlike the Americans yesterday, the Brits did not hoist the Union Jack despite Ian Pinnell winning race 2 in very tactictal conditions.  The weather was unstable with wind blowing mainly from South West 2 to 3 and flukey. It was sunny most of the time but some rain showers cooled down our competitors at times...
        <p>It was hard to find a gap at the buoy given the very large number of boats on the racing course and the traffic is such that some spectacular congestions of 505s have been common in the Quiberon bay area so far.  The Ecole Nationale de Voile is filming the race and shows the tape at the bar... it is awesome and very instructive to watch the competitors manoeuvering at full speed.  Ian Pinnell and his talented crew, Nick Powell, managed to work out the conditions and their speed today was amazing... they had repaired the boat the previous night since the forestay system fell apart in the middle of race 1 preventing them from tuning the boat for light air...only medium tuning was available for most of the race yesterday.
        <p>Howard Hamlin managed to finish second and thus takes the lead of the championship. Howard, whom I interviewed tonight, was still very worried of the outcome of the protest hearing he was involved in tonight for an alleged fault that he had not exonarated himself quick enough according to the German team Mulhbauer/Angela Stenger... Howard was relieved that the jury considered that there was no fault even though he did it, the jury agreed that Howard did not have to do the 720. (Howard was not too upset despite the loss, for Ian's lead was really impressive and he managed to pull back the two places he lost doing the 720 turn).
        <p>A new talented French sailor made the tens today. Laurent Hay is a former 470 champion who took to the 505 a year ago and is improving fast in the class.  Philippe Boite and Jean-Luc Muzellec have now a very slim chance left to win the championship. They caught seaweed on the centerboard yesterday and could not get rid off it easily, and today despite a very good start they found themselves in the middle of a calm patch which made them struggle in the fifties for some time.
        <p>Four protests were lodged with the jury which is still very reasonable given the turnout. Two of them were lodged by the jury himself, one for no buoyancy aid and another for start line infringement withe the guard boat.  For the record, it is interesting to mention that the guard boat was pretty agressive today since he hit one of the British competitors  while manoeuvering around the pathfinder... After the race we learned that he broke his throttle and Vernon was cleared of the infringement...

        <h2><a name="jul4">July 4, 1999 - Quiberon, France</a></h2>
        <p><i>Stars and Stripes for today!!</i>
        <p>After packing up all the boats, the Americans hoisted the Stars and Stripes on the boat park, proudly displaying their mastery of the Quiberon bay. An impressive one-two puts the Americans in pole position for the remainder of the week.  The wind conditions were SW 2-3 with more waves than wind, and more boats than ever before in a 505 world championship. There were 157 boats at the start with 156 lined up waiting for the rabbit to release them after a year of preparation.  The boats included four former 505 world champions and at least thirty who have represented their country at the olympics.  The weather was cloudy with sunny and rainy spells, with all of the heat that was present in the pre-worlds replaced with cooler temperatures.  The wind was steady in direction but not in strength and the local coast effect were felt strongly on a receding tide.
        <p>The Bavarian pathfinder showed everyone that the right side payed, and was placed as the fleet rounded the windward mark.  Despite adding 4 Kg to his boat on measurement day, Shoenherr confirmed the speed he has demonstrated in winning the preWorlds.  Pierre-Jean Gallo and Fabrice Toupet broke the mould for the French team in finishing tenth in front of the star Philippe Boite who normaly leads the French squad.  Marcel Buffet in his late seventies continues to make a tremendeous 63rd proving that he is still in the "peloton" (in reference to the Tour de France).
        <p>Considering there were over 150 boats racing, it is a nice surprise that only two protests were lodged with the Jury, with only one being heard which resulted in a disqualification.  The second protest was rejected due to a confusion on the hearing time letting the faulting boat to get away with the (alleged) infringement which was videotaped and displayed along with the rest of the video coverage of the race.  Will we soon need a third umpire ?
        <p>We all enjoyed such a race with many competitors and it has proven an outstanding success to see so many 5o5s racing in the Quiberon bay. Of course it is special since one can gain or lose so many places with one single "bon coup" or mistake: however the confusion created by the many boat wakes was very difficult to sail in.
        <p>Everybody is impressed with the huge task which has been completed by the ENV and the international class team to organise the event so smoothly.  The 5o5 family warmly welcomed Paul Henderson, the ISAF president, who made the trip to Quiberon to attend the World championship, tomorrow and Tuesday. Paul will have the opportunity to meet with the 5o5ers and sail himself a 5o5 for the first time.
        <p>What will be remembered is the wonderful turnout and the beautiful 5o5 fleet racing in the Quiberon bay...
        <p>Regards
