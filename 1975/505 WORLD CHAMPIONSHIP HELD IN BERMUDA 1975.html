		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Hamilton, Bermuda - 
		</font></b><font size="4">The United Kingdom's Dr. John Loveday apparently followed his own prescription and emerged a convincing winner of the 5-0-5 World Championships held Oct. 5-12 in Bermuda.
			</font>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Competing against 69 other boats from 13 countries, Loveday defeated several former 5-0-5 champions with finishes of 1-1-1-2-1-10 in the six race, five to count, series. Second and third places went to Frenchmen Jean-Marie Danielou and 53-year-old Marcel Buffet.</font><p align="justify">
			<font size="4">With temperatures, both of air and water, in the upper 70s and a cold front bringing in winds from the north and east at velocities ranging from 25 to six knots, the dinghy sailors had a variety of conditions in which to compete, But heavy air, light air, a steep chop or gentle wavelets, Loveday and crewman Lewis Dann mastered them all.</font><p align="justify">
			<font size="4">Loveday set the pace for the rest of the series in his first win. Winning by three and a half minutes, he was never seriously challenged. With fellow Englishman Larry Marks and Frenchman Danielou following him across, Loveday said, he had eased off when he had a good lead to minimize the risk of gear damage or capsizings in the steep, three or four foot seas.</font><p align="justify">
			<font size="4">The start of the second race Tuesday afternoon was marked by two general recalls. Sweden's lone representative, Karl Nilsson, got off to a good start in lighter, 15 knot winds and led the fleet around the first weather mark followed by two French boats, Levesque and Buffet. Loveday rounded the mark in sixth place but had moved to within second place by the first leeward mark passing Buffet on the second windward leg and maintaining his lead until the end.</font><p align="justify">
			<font size="4">Winds lightened again on Wednesday but Loveday adjusted. After a less than perfect start, he rounded the first weather mark in fifth place behind Bill Pattison of the U.S. in first, Derek Farrant of the U.K., Buffet and Danielou. Loveday had moved up to third by the leeward mark and had passed Pattison and Farrant by the second weather mark. Loveday was seriously challenged on the final reach by Australia's
    Geoff Kyrwood who had started the race far down in the pack, but surfed to within striking distance of Loveday by the final leeward mark. Loveday lengthened his lead on the beat and finished 40 seconds ahead of Kyrwood.</font><p align="justify">
			<font size="4">Yves Pajot, 
			<a href="../../../505web/marst74.htm" style="text-decoration: none">last year's 5-0-5 champion</a>, avenged his previous three defeats on Thursday when he finished three seconds ahead of Lovedav. The finish was all the more remarkable, however, considering that Loveday was in 11th place after the first triangle, moved into sixth position on the beat to weather and the flow, then passed the remaining boats on the last triangle to place second, Loveday's best was yet to come, however. With world class sailors competing, it seems almost inconceivable that Loveday could finish five minutes ahead of his nearest rival, but he did in race four. If the race had had another leg, spectators felt he would have lapped the last place boats.</font><p align="justify">
			<font size="4">With an unbeatable total of only three points going into the last race, Loveday could have relaxed on Shelly Bay beach, or in the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club, but he chose to go out and race with the rest of them. With the pressure off, he finished in 10th place. Second and third places overall were still up for grabs among several sailors including Larry Marks, Jon Andron of the U.S., the U.K.'s Peter Colclough as well as Danielou and Buffet.</font><p align="justify">
			<font size="4">D. Zanks of the U.S. led the fleet up until the last half minute of the race before being out-tacked by Danielou. Buffet's fifth place finish was enough to give him third overall 
			– both Frenchmen had disqualifications to throw out.
