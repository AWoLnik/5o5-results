Pfingstbush regatta in Kiel 30/5 1/6 1998
by Tom Boejland
35 boats from GER - DEN - SWE

Strong competition with Krister Bergstrom and Jorgen Schonher both former
worldchampions, anf of course Wolfgang Hunger god of the 470!

First day, sun, 6 feet wawes, up to 35 knots - only a few boats didīnt
capsizes, it was hard work but fun for everybody (may the best swimmer win)

Hunger won the first and Bergstrom the second race.

Second day, sun, 2 feet wawes and 5 - 10 knots.

Third race was won again by Hunger and the firth by Axel Oberremm in shifty
conditions.

Third day, no sun, 2 feet of wawes and 10 - 18 knots Hunger won the fifth race
and didīnt have to sail the last one. Schonherr won the sixt race.

What else did I observe in Kiel?

Still 1.5 hours to racecourse (i think thats why we where only 35 boats)

Still stubbit bownumbers which is falling of just after you come in open waters
every day, but the Kieler Yacht Club WILL pollute the bay of Kiel (if hope al
that plastic donīt float to Denmark, because the rest of the classes had the
same problem - 600 boats!!!)

Not so much rain as normal in Kiel

Bergstrom presented a new setup - sails in monofilm with "tapedrive"

Still a jury believing that Pfingstbush is more important than the olympics and
worlds and treating us as childs (eksample each morning the jury will check
bands on the booms at the boatpark, and they will dsq. you if the band only is
black, it has to be BLACK!!! (new painted each day!!!)

The races was okay, but maybe its time look around and go to some of the other
good 505 races in Germany instead of KYC.
