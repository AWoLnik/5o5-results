1998 505 East Coast Championship

The 3-day 505 East Coast Champs was held last weekend at the Hyannis YC (site
of the 1998 Worlds). About 26 boats registered. A cold front on Friday brought
plenty of wind (15-20 knots) and a light rain. The weather on Saturday was
about as good as it gets with sunny skies, temps in the low 80's and winds at
about 15 knots. On Sunday a nice sea breeze came through at about noon and
built to around 12 knots just as everyone sailed in at 2 PM. Tim Collins and
Bill Smith won the event by sailing with consistency which was important
because there were no drops in the seven race series. Nick Trotman and Mike
Mills were tied with Collins/Smith going into the last day. A 12th on Friday
hurt Trotman/Mills despite winning two races and finishing very well in others.
Collins/Smith beat Trotman/Mills in both races on Sunday to secure the win.
Tyler Moore and Scott Ikle were close to the leaders in points and finished
third. The top three boats had fantastic boat speed and tactics in all
conditions. Canadians Jeff Boyd and Martin tenHove had a superb second day of
racing to secure fourth and Barney Harris and Jesse Falsone came back from a
poor start to place fifth.
