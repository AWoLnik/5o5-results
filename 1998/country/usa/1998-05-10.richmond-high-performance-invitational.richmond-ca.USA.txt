Richmond YC 505 Regatta, May 1998

Well there it is! The third regatta of the west coast worlds qualifying series!
Bruce and Dave pretty much dominated the regatta! Jeff Miller and Jim Wondoleck
were the only ones to break up the no hitter with their win in the fourth race
on Sunday morning. Ellen and Alan sailed a great series, hanging in there in
the breeze Saturday then putting on the burners Sunday in the lighter
conditions. Doug Hagen and Kirk Wilson showed great form by getting a port tack
start in race number two! Bob Little and Graham showed some big breeze wheels
and almost beat the boys in blue to the weather mark! Race one would you
believe almost 2 hours in 20 knots of wind? and they cut the course by 1/3! No
short course sailing at RYC! Thanks to all the Out-of-towners for coming to the
bay to play! Robin and Rich- Vancouver. Bob Noyes- Idaho. Bruce Tilley-LA. Bob
and Graham-La-La land. Ben Benjerman-Humbolt CA. Jim Wondoleck-back from the
dead!
