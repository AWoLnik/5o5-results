Danish Championship
Dear Friends.
The Danish nationals were sailed on Lake Esrum june 26 - 28.

15 boats participated and 5 races where sailed in light to medium conditions.

The races were fun, the beer was cold, and the steaks where well done and besides that, a very friendly club hosted the event.

Schonherr/Bojsen Moller won the title with only one point after a close match with Bojland/Friis.
