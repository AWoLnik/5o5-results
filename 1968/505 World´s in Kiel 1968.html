				<p align="left"><font size="6">505 World Championship 1968<br>
				</font><font size="5"><i>Philip Wilson reports from Kiel</i></font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font COLOR="#000000" size="4"><b>

        SRC="../pix/505-vm.jpg" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" width="637" height="407"></b></font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">For the first time, entry for the
        International 505 World Championship was restricted to 75 boats. This resulted in an
        extremely high standard of racing between top helmsmen from 15 different countries,
        gathered in Kiel harbour from August 25th to September 1st.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">In the light, variable winds which were the order for most of the week, place changing was
        often dramatic and only three boats, all French, showed any measure of consisteney. In the
        end it was Marcel Troupel and Phillipe Lanaverre in 'Rififi' from Bordeaux who snatched
        the title, at the eleventh hour, from 16 years old Yves Pajot and his 14 years old brother
        Marc in 'Leopard'. Marcel Buffet in 'Ya Za' was his usual brilliant self in light weather
        but was unable to stay with the leaders in a breeze and sank to third after heading the
        overall list at the half-way stage.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The courses were huge and it was essential
        to pick the right way up the first two mile beat. Perhaps so many well-known names were
        left stranded because it rarely paid to tack on the many windsbifts, but to go right out
        on one tack, usually the wrong one theoretically. Few of the British boats really got to
        grips but Derek and Robin Farrant, former world champions in 'Miss VI' averted a complete
        rout by finishing in fourth position. Larry Marks, current national champion and hot tip
        for the title before battle commenced, was seventh.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">As the fleet beat out
        to the start of the first racc on a Riviera-like day, a dense fog suddenly appeared. The
        start was delayed for over an hour and then the fog dispersed as rapidly as it had settled
        and the championship was on, unfortunately without four boats including 'Samuel Esquire'
        and 'Orang Outang' of Britain, stranded a mile away. Their protest against the cornmittec
        was disallowed.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">Troupel showed from the outset that he
        meant business by securing a handy lead for 'Rififi' at the weather mark. Buffet followed,
        chased hard by Pierre Poullain in 'Viking'. Behind, the fleet spread out remarkably, those
        choosing the port side of the course being out of the racc already. Peter Bainbridge in
        'Anaconda' was the only Englishman in the first twenty on the.first lap but lost over
        fifteen places on the second beat. The leading three inereased their advantage and Troupel
        was able to take it easy on the final leg, while Buffet and Poullain had a great tactical
        battle up to the line. Poullain failed to breakthrough, and then learned that he was
        adjudged over the starting line, letting 'Piok' sailed by J. Laurizen, danish national
        champion, into third berth.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">Marcel Buffet strengthened his claim to a third world title with a victory in
        another Force 1-2 north easterly in the second race. Again, the starboard side of the
        course was favourite and 'Ya Za' and Larry Marks in 'Mu-Watsui-Go-Go' chose the right path
        and headed the downwind stream, with Peter Bainbridge in fourth place. Buffet and Marks
        really opened out on the second spinnaker reach and at the start of the second beat, the
        Englishman appeared to be through but Buffet tacked away as a gigantic wind shift carved
        down the middle of the course. Those below it were left struggling whilst those above were
        freed off for the mark.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">Buffet came out of this with a longer lead
        over Marks. The intended dead run proved to be a trapezing spinnaker reach, giving
        competitors their first taste of speed. The wind gradually died off again on the beat
        home, a leg made even longer by repositioning of the top mark. Buffet had increased his
        lead and Marks dropped one place on a windshift to Jean-Marie Danilou of France, who was
        later protested out. Official third was Pajot.<br></font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The sun gave way to a
        misty, grey Tuesday for the third race with a Force3-4 creating a confused chop in a
        surprisingly short time. At the third attempt from a slightly starboard-biased line, crews
        found the truest wind of the week. The Scandinavians found this to their liking with the
        Swedish 'Pueblo' sailed by Thomas Haraldson leading the way with compatriots Goran Kallfelt
        in 'Scaramouche' and Christer Bath in 'Kalabalik'. 'Miss VI' was at last away well in
        fifth place and 'Anaconda', 'Samuel Esquire' (H. Bourn), 'Seduction' (J.
        Pattinson),
        'Puddle-duck' (G. Wilson) and 'Orang Outang' (M. Platts) were all in the first twenty.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The wind could not hold a steady course for
        long and strange things happened on the second beat, 'Anaconda' again being on the
        reeciving end, losing places wholesale. 'Miss VI', moving into fourth downwind, lost two
        places at the end of the beat in a sticky patch, but 'Pueblo' hung on to the lead with
        'Faux Pas' (Danilou) sailing fast to windward behind. Wi h a little.more wind on the final
        beat 'Kalabalik' really strated moving and thrashed through from fourth place to snatch
        the gun from 'Pueblo'. 'Faux Pas' was third with Troupel in fourth place and 'Miss VI'
        recovered one place to finish fifth.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The next day was a
        rest day and,
        of course, provided a perfect sailing breeze.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The fog again clamped
        down and the start of the fourth race on Thursday was postponed from the shore.
        Eventually, there was a slight improvement and the decision was taken to race just outside
        the harbour wall. The breeze again was only around Force 1-2 and the majority of the
        fleet, after two general recalls, beated towards the shore. 'Miss VI', after a poor get
        away, tacked out and arrived at the windward mark first, squeezing through on port ahead
        of previous winner 'Kalabalik'. J.Cordonnier of France in 'Cul See' was right up with
        Buffet with H.Cudmore of Ireland in 'Overdrawn' challenging. 'Kalabalik' could not sustain
        the pressure in the light going and dropped back on the wind. 'Miss VI' looked set for an
        easy victory and Buffet's' Ya Za' was pulling through to second place.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">At the start of the final leg. 'Ya Za'
        split tacks and unaccountably negleeted to cover those behind, losing four places
        irnmediately. Cudrnore drove under 'MissVI's' lee when she tacked off to cover 'Cul See'.
        At the line, 'Overdrawn' was still there with 'Miss VI' just behind. 'YaZa's' disastrous
        manoeuvre had let 'Leopard' into fourth place and with Troupel caught in the ruck,
        'Leopard' seemed the best bet for the championship.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The fifth race was unusual in that, with the light breeze coming slightly more
        from the north, it paid to hang on to the port side of the course. Two English boats
        'Wazzamarack' (N.Duguid) and 'Anaconda' rounded but the Tanon brothers in 'Alea' moved
        through downwind. TheTanons have won world championship races in the past and although
        they sail somewhat infrequently now, their tactics are still excellent and they kept ahead
        on the next beat. 'Wazzamarack' and 'Anaconda' lost touch, keeping to what had proved the
        best way on the first lap, but 'Miss VI' had recovered from a terrible start and was
        steadily catching the leaders. At the start of the dead run, it was 'Alea' and 'Leopard'
        togetber, 'Ya Za' third followed by 'Miss VI', 'Overdrawn' and 'Rififi'. This was an
        agonising leg with barely enough wind to keep the spinnakers flying. 'Alea' went off on
        the Port gybe followed by 'Miss VI', 'Leopard' and 'Ya Za' chose the other route and at
        the bottom mark, it was apparent that the former two had benefited and 'Alea's' spinnaker
        came down two minutes before 'Leopard's'.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">'Miss VI' was round in front of 'Ya Za' and
        with only the one beat to go, it seemed that these would be the final positions. However,
        Troupel, well behind in sixth place, steadily took yards out of those in front. 'Alea's'
        lead was gradually whittled down by 'Leopard' but she covered all the way to the line and
        won by a whisker, whilst Troupel had passed three boats by pure boat speed to finish
        third. 'Miss VI' and 'Ya Za' slipped back to fifth and sixth behind 'Overdrawn'.<br>The results gave the charnpionship a dramatic turn - three boats 'Leopard', 'Rififi' and
        'Ya Za' within one point of one another, with only one race to go. Of these, 'Leopard' was
        the most consistent, her worst position so far being a seventh. The other two had to have
        a good race to win.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The committee brought forward the starting time of the final race by an hour
        to 10.30 a.m. This was not a popular decision as most crews were somewhat weary after a
        week of cocktail parties and they were greeted by driving rain and a Force 4 wind, with
        odd gusts a little more and a heavy, rolling sea built up. Unaccountably, after all the
        early preparation, the start was delayed for half an hour. At last the start came and it
        was right first time. With a good wind and miles away from land it was unthinkable that
        one side was going ta pay much more than the other but those who stood right out on port
        were at least a quarter. of a mile ahead of those who chose the other way. John Pattison
        arrived first at the weathermark in 'Seduction' just in front of Gordon Rogers in
        'Hornblower' with the heavy weather expert 'Kalabalik' in third place. 'Leopard' was next
        round, well ahead of 'Rififi', with 'Ya Za' nowhere.</font></p>
				<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">It looked as though the Pajot brothers were
        certain to be the youngest winners of the world championship as they moved up to the lead
        when disaster struck. Their spinnaker ripped clean off from the head. Despite this
        tragedy, they still carried on and although dropping to fifteenth downwind, came back on
        the beats to finish ninth. 'Seduction' held on to her lead grimly over the first lap, but
        once 'Kalabalik' was through, she thrashed away to a really convincing win. Troupel,
        seeing his chance with 'Leopard' limping, urged 'Rififi' along and on the final beat, when
        a vicious rainstorm reduced visibility to100 yards, eased inte second place to take the
        1968 world title. Danilou, after a bad start, came through to take third place, whilst
        Pattison faded slightly to sixth.</font></p>

					</table>
					<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">'Rififi', the winner, was made by Lanaverre
            and very simply fitted out. The only gadget on board was a mast adjuster. Her Tasker sails
            were set on a Proctor E section mast and stiff boom. 'Leopard', the runner-up and most
            consistent boat there, is British-built by Parker, as were the next six boats. Both Pajot
            and Buffet set sails by Christ of Paris, again on E section masts, but Pajot used a
            Proctor bendy boom.</font></p>
					<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">The majority of the fleet seemed to favour
            British boats with Parker having the lion's share. Rondar boats, too, were well in
            evidence. The championship certainly caused a great deal of interest in new British boats.</font></p>
					<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">Most of the boats are now rigged with
            centre travellers but it was interesting to note that the Swedish boats all are sheeted at
            the transom and there is no question that they are the fastest boats in a breeze, led by
            'Kalabalik'. It was difficult to tell very much else regarding boat speed in the intensely
            variable conditions, but the outstanding feature of the week was the emergence of 16 years
            old Pajot as a possible future Elvström.</font></p>
