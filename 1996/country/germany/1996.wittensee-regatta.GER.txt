Wittensee Regatta

This year 53 boats from Germany, Denmark, Sweden and UK entered the yearly
Wittensee Regatta in Germany.

The race is sailed on a small lake in northern Germany, and hosted by the local
club.

Sadly it was only possible to sail Saturday because of zero visibility Sunday
(and no wind too!).

This year there was a close race between the german top teams Hunger/Jess,
Böger/wierht, Gosch/Meyer, and Nilsson/Gorge from Sweden and the Danish team
Bøjland/Friis.

After 2 exiting races in 8-15 knots the results was the following.
