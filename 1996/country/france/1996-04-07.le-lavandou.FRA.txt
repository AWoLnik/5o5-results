Thanks to Richard Lefevre for writing this report on the Le Lavandou Europa Cup event
Le Lavandou is one of the five regattas each year that count for the Europa Cup. It is the one with the maximum number of crews : 97 this year, because of the worlds running at the same time, 120 crews last year.
Friday, April 5th :
First heat: light wind. Pinnel-Darling (GBR 8264) won from the French champions Boite-Muzellec (FRA 8402).
Second heat: very light wind, less than 2 Beaufort and vanishing during the heat. 60 crews were eliminated bu the half-hour time limit! The race was won by Boardman-Godfrey (GBR 8481) with a german crew second: Thumann-Oldigs (GER 8279).
Saturday, 6th :
Third heat : Solar breeze rotating but very light. The germans Bohm-Roos (GER 8477) were leading with Pinnel-Darling 2nd, but Boite-Muzellec, who were 30th in the last leg, took an extreme right board and finally win the heat.
All the following heats were cancelled because the wind decides to "stop the propellers."

The top three overall:
Boardman-Godfrey
Pinnel-Darling
Boite-Muzellec
I don't know if the above is understandable, but it's the best I can do ...

Bye !

Richard Lefevre.
