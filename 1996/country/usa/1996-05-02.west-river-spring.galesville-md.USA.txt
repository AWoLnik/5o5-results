West River Spring 1996

Terry Neff and Bobby Noyes took delivery of their new Waterat in June of '95,
after chartering 505s for several North American Championships, a Midwinters
and one pre-worlds, and having been sailing in the class on and off for over
twenty years. Terry demonstrated why he was an intercollegiate All-American by
winning West River Spring, his first 505 regatta win in twenty years. As we all
know, the crew is as important as the skipper in a 505, so we should mention
that Ethan Bixby was crewing for Terry.

Twelve teams gathered together on the weekend of May 1-2 at the West River
Yacht Club near Baltimore, MD to kick off the beginning of the 505 season.
Entrants included prior World Champion Ethan Bixby and two-time North American
Champion Macy Nelson as well as several newcomers to the class, including Jesse
Falsone crewing for Allan Johnson, Paul Heads(a New Zealander using his
self-designed Quantum jib snd spinnaker), and Colin Gordon crewing for Macy
Nelson.

Saturday's racing included 3 short, light-wind, intercollegiate-like races in
variable winds. Early results sported Henry Amthor with his brother, Doug
Amthor, as the early leaders. Sunday beckoned with promising northeast winds in
the morning following a front line that went threw at night, but the breeze
quickly faded, and the resulting 4 races were also in light, shifting winds.
