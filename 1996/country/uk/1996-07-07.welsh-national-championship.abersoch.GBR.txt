The  505 Welsh National Championships 1996

Sunshine, wind and cool temperatures greeted the competitors at South
Caernarvonshire Yacht Club on the 6/7 July, for the Ronstan Welsh
Championships.

Two races were sailed on Saturday in 12-15 knots. Both were lead from Start to
Finish by Ian Barker and Ian Godfrey, it was a brave decision by Godfrey to
crew for Barker as his last 3 crews have ended up in hospital for a variety of
ailements. Clive Robinson and Gary Cawthorne showed good speed in the lighter
conditions to finish second in both races with Robin Boardman, Ian Montague,
Martin Hodgeson and Robert Larke mixing it up for the next few places. Mark
Greaves and Lisa Reedy made a staring appearance in Race 1, nearly piping
Robinson for second place.

Sunday dawned very bright and loud for those who fully participated in Ronstans
'Happy Three Hours' on Saturday night. One obvious participant was Ian Barker
who was disqualified from Race 3 for not posting his tally before launching, a
race which he won by nearly three minutes. Robin Boardman and Gareth Kelly were
first round the windward mark and second at the finish but his presence of mind
prior to going afloat gave him first place. Martin Hodgson and Paul Beasley
were second.

Barker won the last race cliching the series. Ian Montague and Jeff Kimber were
second with Martin Hodgeson third. Boardman finished fourth giving him second
overall. The next five places were separated by just 6 points.
