The father and son team from Sakonnet Yacht Club in Rhode Island took
home the 2020 East Coast Championship trophy after three days of
exciting and close racing at Hampton Yacht Club. Friday offered up winds
in excess of 25 knots with some gusts in race three over 30! Saturday
and Sunday morning (before the front) offered up manageable but windy
conditions as well for a total of nine races to complete the regatta.

Racing was tight, going into the final race Ingalls held a one point
lead over HYC team Clark Hayes and Eric Schwab, Henry Amthor and Chris
Pfrang had a close battle with Dave Kirkpatrick and Parker Colantuano
from Sail Newport. In the end Henry and Chris ended up fourth, Dave and
Parker third, Clark and Eric took second, and the father son pair of
John and Luke Ingalls took first.

Whitney Hayes and Anna Patterson from HYC took home the trophy for the
highest finishing All-Womenâ€™s Team and Benton Amthor and Marcus Adams
took home the highest finishing
U-25 Team.

A huge thank you to PRO Mark Wheeler with Kathy Wheeler on the RC
boat, Tom and Debbie Ryan for running the windward mark boat and John
Periera for riding with Maxwell Plarr in the Gate Launch.

Luke currently is attending the University of Rhode Island, John is
the head sailing coach at Salve Regina in Newport.
