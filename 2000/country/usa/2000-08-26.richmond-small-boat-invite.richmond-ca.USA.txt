Richmond Small Boat Invite
Aug 26-27

The SF Bay again delivered good breeze for the 505s this past weekend as
Richmond YC put on an event of there usual high caliber. A relatively low
turnout of 9 boats (compared to 45 two weeks ago)showed up for tight racing in
15 to 18 knots of breeze in every race. This was the last west coast event
before the boats get loaded for Durban so the top teams were geared up for the
breeze.

505 legend John Gilmore made a guest appearance on Sunday sailing with Jeff
Miller. Jeff's regular crew Paul Allan sailed on Saturday. The Team of three
wound up in forth place overall. Super crew Jeff Nelson turn down sailing with
Howie to join up with Nick Adamson this weekend. Jeff and Nick were fast the
whole way around the course they used their speed to finish up the weekend in
third. The Young Bucks (Benny and Andy) were sailing Higher than any other team
and took 2nd overall. Steve Bourdow and Mike Martin still hot off their NAs win
took the event with four 1st and a 4th.
