Santa Cruz One Design Spring Open
May 20-21, 2000

19 Boats, not 17 boats, showed up for the annual spring event. 5 teams made the
trek from Southern California, Robin and John from BC/Washington, and Sol
Marini and Dennis Snyder came out all the way from New Hampshire/Ohio to pick
up Dennis's new Waterat and sail the regatta. Apologies to Aaron Ross and Greg
Sorrells, and Bailey White and Jeff Lomber for some confusion that omitted
their scores!!

Both days was BEAUTIFUL sailing with winds from 12 to 20 knots. Air temp on the
water in the 60's, at the harbor in the 80's. All courses were sailed on long
triangle windward leewards. Saturday's first race saw current world champ Howie
Hamlin and Peter Alarie jump out and win the race in great form. Saturday's
second race saw the infamous light easterly wind envelope the course after the
triangle, Thompson/Zinn and Edwards/Shelton missed the mandatory upwind gate
and the lead went to Martin/Bourdow. They lead the second triangle only to lose
all their air letting 14 legend Zack Berkowitz and Andrew Mercer sneak in for
the win, in Andrew's new boat.

Sunday was all about Mike Martin & Steve Bourdow (aka "Team Steve Martin") who
dominated the days racing after repeatedly throwing kelp in front of Edwards
and Shelton to keep them from catching them on the first beats. They displayed
great sailing and top speed to win the day with 3 firsts! But alas, since they
boned the 2nd race and there was no throwouts, Hamlin and Alarie won the event.
