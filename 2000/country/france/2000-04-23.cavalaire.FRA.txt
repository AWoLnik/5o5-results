Cavalaire sur Mer, 21/22/23 April

Jean-Baptiste Dupont reports:

Cavalaire on the French Riviera hosted the first year 2000 Europa Cup
over the Easter weekend. 83 fiveohs from Germany, France, Switzerland,
Danemark, England, Sweden turned out for a very competitive regatta.

8 races were run combining Olympiques and super Olympiques triangles
under a great Organization. Ian Pinnell from the UK was out of reach
on the first day in Force 4 conditions with a 2nd, 1st, 1st placing in
the three first races but his performance on the two first races of
Saturday in very light conditions did not allow him to stay in the
lead. He was taken over by the French team who had sailed very
consistently at the top of the fleet regardless of the wind
fluctuations. On Sunday, in very flucky conditions varying from 5 to
1 the battle was very tough between the two teams but finally Philippe
Boite and Jean-Luc Muzellec made it without having to race the last
race.

Jean-Luc, who is the president of the 5o5 French class, said that
Ian was unlucky the second day with a bad jib choice who forced him
to return to the shore and made him miss the start of a key 5th
race.
