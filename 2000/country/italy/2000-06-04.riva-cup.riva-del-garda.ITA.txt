Europa Cup, Riva, Lake Garda, 1-4 June 2000
Report from Dave Smithwhite:
Fifty three 5o5 crews from six nations descended upon the small town of
Riva del Garda in Italy to compete in the Riva Cup 2000 event,
a qualifying round of the 5o5 Europa Cup. Racing was held at the
northern end of Lake Garda along with Contenders, Korsars and
International 14 dinghies. The Dias class (a Soling like keelboat) also
shares the course, an aspect of the regatta that strikes fear into the
hearts of all dinghy sailors.
The 505 class completed a full series of seven races, six of which were
held in classic Lake Garda conditions, sun and 20 to 30 knots of breeze.
Race 7 was held in approximately 15 knots.

The racing was very close throughout the regatta with short tacking
close to the cliffs and chasing the strongest wind bands downwind. The
course was a sausage followed by a square that gave a good variety of
downwind sailing.

The winners were the Moller brothers from Denmark with 13 points
followed by Dave Smithwhite and Neil Fulcher from the UK with 13.2
points. The Gorge brothers from Germany finished third. The top three
boats never finished outside of the top five that made for a cliffhanger
of a last race with all three capable of winning the regatta. The
overall results were not settled until the last run of the last race
when the Moller Brothers picked up a gust close to the leeward mark and
managed to overtake 2nd placed Fili Stockmann from Germany to put a boat
between himself and Smithwhite which won him the regatta. Vernon Ralston
and Simon Spratt from Thorpe Bay Yacht Club sailed a distinguished
series to finish 7th overall never finishing outside of the top ten and
showing awesome upwind speed.
