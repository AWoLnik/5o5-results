505 UK Inland Championship, Grafham Water Sailing Club, 15/16 April

Ian Pinnell reports:

Thirty 505's made the trip to Grafham Water for the opening event of the
year. For many this was an opportunity to blow away the winter cobwebs
prior to heading off to the South of France and a Europa Cup event the
following weekend. Although it was meant to be spring, competitors were
greeted with a gusty force 4 to 5 and temperatures that failed to reach
5 degrees. With a slight port bias on the line Ian Pinnell and Nick
Powell made a near perfect start and were never to be caught, leading
the first race from start to finish. Dave Smithwhite and Neil Fulcher
took second and Richard Sims and Simon Wood took third. After a break
for lunch many of the competitors decided that an early shower was the
order of the day and decided not to compete in the next two races.
For those who did compete there was some exhilarating sailing to be
experienced. In the second race first and second places were
a repeat of the mornings race whilst in third place Dave Peacock and
Chris Hewkin started to find their legs. The third race saw Pinnell
once again take an early lead only to capsize on the first gybe
mark. In the end Peacock took first place, Pinnell took second and
Stuart Turnbull and Jason Lunn third.

Sunday couldn't have been more different to Saturday with clear blue
skies and light breezes. The change in conditions also led to
a change at front of the fleet. Debbie Jarvis sailing with her
husband Mark Darling won race four with Charles Walters and
Christian Diebitsch taking second place and Sam Neal and Andy
Johnson taking third. Jarvis was obviously finding the conditions to
her suiting as she won race five with Sims taking second place and
Terry Scutcher and his new crew, Ray Chittock taking third place.
The final race saw a slight increase in the wind to marginal
trapezing conditions. Clive Robinson and Gary Cawthorn took the
honours with Jarvis in second and Sims take third.
