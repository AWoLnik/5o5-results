505 Short Course Championship, Stone SC, 3/4 June 2000

Mike Holt reports:

Over the weekend of June the 3rd and 4th a fleet depleted to 18 boats
due to a clash with the slightly more exotic draw of a European Cup
meeting in Riva came to the line to contest the Stone Open and Short
Course Championships. Saturday's weather was sunny with a light sea
breeze over a strong spring ebb tide. Clive Robinson and Gary Cawthorn
totally dominated with 2 wins from 2 races with Hector Cisneros and
Laurence Crispin the only boat closely challenging with a 2, 4.

Sunday however dawned bright but with 12-14 knots of wind from the South
West. Race 3 saw Ian Montague and Geoff Kimber move into contention with
a win while Robinson posted a 5th with Cisneros finishing 3rd. Race
4 saw Mike Holt and Ian Godfrey start showing some speed, with a win,
Robinson and Cisneros still however the pace makers with 3rd and 4th
respectively. Holt followed this with a win in race 5 chased all the
way by Cisneros in 2nd with Robinson further back down in 6th.

So as usual at Stone it was going to go down to the last race, in fact
it went down to the last mark of the last race. Robinson believing
that it was only Holt who could beat him sailed him down the fleet on
the first beat, going around the windward mark towards the back with
Holt second from last, Cisneros was now at the front only to be sent
home by the race committee for an OCS leaving the race wide open for
Martin Goult and Gordon Russell to win comfortably. Meanwhile Holt was
on the comeback moving quickly up the fleet, passing the necessary
last 2 boats to move into 2nd at the last leeward mark to win the
meeting by 1 point from Cisneros, with Robinson another point back in
3rd.

As ever a well run event both on and off the water with a very good
short course format.
