Light winds plagued the 505 UK Nationals in Weymouth, with the first two days
seeing no racing at all, then four races packed into Monday, and only a single
race possible on the final day.

Tom Gillard and Geoff Edwards prevailed in the end, taking the title by a
single point ahead of Roger Gilbert & Ben McGrane with Penny & Russ Clark
completing the podium.

Take a look at the Ingrid Abery photo gallery above to see some of the light
wind action.
