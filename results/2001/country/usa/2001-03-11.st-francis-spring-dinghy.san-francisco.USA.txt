St. Francis Spring Dinghy

16 505s showed up for this years St. Francis Spring Dinghy regatta. It was a
beautiful weekend with sunny skies and 15 knot winds both days. The 1999 world
champion team of Mike and Howie reunited and won the event with fellow Team
Tuesday members Ben Benjamin and Andy Beeckman close behind in second. Stewart
Park and Doug Hagen showing that they will be a force to be reckoned with this
season took third. The debriefing after the racing had a good flow of
information and lots of participation.

The next event is the Richmond Yacht Club Big Dingy Regatta on April 7th and
8th which is the first event in the west coast container ranking series. This
should a big regatta since there are currently 14 boats from the west coast
that want to go to the Worlds.
