Santa Cruz Regatta

This years Santa Cruz regatta was not the typical "blow the dog off the chain"
Santa Cruz. Unfortunately it was light to medium both days. The first day
didn't blow above 10 knots with little swell but quite choppy. With the stellar
race committee had the pin was favoured which proved to be a good place to
start as the left side also was favoured. Three races were held this day and a
good time by all. The fiercely competitive fleet once again exchanged bullets
as many different people were up at the top and a lot of good guys still not
far behind. Often the weather mark had the leader and the last place boat
within 30 seconds of each other. The after-racing talk brought up good points
about boat tuning and what the top guys were doing to go fast all around the
course. Sorry, NO free beer. The second day started off with a little more
breeze and picked up to about 12 or so. The really flat water made is easier to
figure out what side of the course was favoured and put an emphasis on boat
handling and raw speed (doesn't it always). Mike and Howie won every race this
day with solid first beats and breakaway boatspeed. What can you do against
that? I want to thank the SCYC, and Dave Wahley for putting on another sweet
regatta and Bruce Edwards and West Marine for supplying the trophies. Also to
everybody who showed up; great turnout. Let's get fired up for Richmond where
there really will be some breeze, hopefully, and drag your friends out to enjoy
the racing.
