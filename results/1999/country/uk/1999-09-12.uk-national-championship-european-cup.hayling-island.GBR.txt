National Championships
Hayling Island SC, 9th-12th September
Report: Rob Napier

The exceptionally hot weather for early September gave a very pleasant but
almost entirely light wind regatta. Only on the last day was there a decent
"flat out" breeze, and even that had curious holes and shifts later in the
race. Also, it was the time of big spring tides (one month after the eclipse),
which influenced some races.

HISC was excellent as always; very professional. Robin, the race officer, did
us proud under the circumstances, giving us a full programme of seven races,
albeit some on the short side. In distance, the last race was probably the
longest, even though the Race of the Year on Saturday had its traditional extra
lap. In the tricky conditions and (generally) shortish races, it was not
surprising that most of us had our ups and downs (particularly the latter, it
always seems). So Ian Pinnell's consistency was even more impressive.

The young newcomers Cram/Cram and Robinson/Phillips had their moments, both
with at least one top ten result, and the amazing sight of Chris Robinson vying
with his dad for the lead in race two.

Socially it was fun; HISC brings everyone together, with many staying on site,
and there were more families that in recent years. Altogether a good regatta.
