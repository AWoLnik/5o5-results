Weymouth Open
Weymouth Sailing Centre - 21/22 August 1999
Report: Mike Holt

Over the weekend of 21st and 22nd of August the 505 fleet visited Weymouth. For
the first time this year sunshine and good breeze met the fleet. Saturday saw
the fleet racing in Weymouth bay in 15-18 knots of breeze on a well laid course
with large waves. Racing was dominated by Simon Payne and Bill Masterman with
two wins and a 2nd and Mike Holt and Ian Godfrey with a win and two 2nds. In
the chasing pack behind, Clive Robinson and Gary Cawthorn were fighting it out
with Martin Hodgson and Alaster Macleod followed by Paul Lovesy and Andy
Williams.

Come Sunday morning, the breeze had increased into the 20+ knot range. Race
Officer Dr Frank Newton made the excellent decision to race inside Portland
harbour. The extra breeze was certainly to Holt and Godfreyâ€™s liking as they
sailed away to win all 3 races, however things are never quite as they seem and
they were pushed hard by Payne and Masterman who failed to keep the mast in the
air as much as they would have liked and ended the weekend with Bill flying
through his mainsail.

As racing went on Rob Napier (circular man!), sailing again with Keith
Summersgill, was improving and the weekend also saw the return to the fleet of
Richard Lord guiding Simon Lake around in Simon's boat showing good upwind
speed at times.

Consistent sailing allowed Robinson to take advantage and finish the weekend in
2nd place with Hodgson 3rd. This was most definitely the best weekend's sailing
of the year, good winds good courses....Great fun... so where were you?
