1995 New England Championship

by Tyler Moore

The 505 New England Championships were held at Hyannis, MA on September 9-10
amid a passing cold front. Eight boats attended (Editor's note: this was a new
event, scheduled part way through the season, which may have accounted for the
low turnout) and all were very disappointed on Saturday due to the fact that
there was no wind. Colin Merrett of Rondar Raceboats in England drove up from
Connecticut to see what Hyannis was like and is maybe wondering about the site
of the 1998 Worlds. Needless to say no one was happy. This was eased by a party
that night a Tyler's house (half the fleet was staying there). On Sunday the
wind gods decided to pay us back for their mishap the day before and everyone
awoke to a blustery northerly.

During the racing the race committee clocked one gust at 34 mph. Everyone has a
great time racing especially newcomers Bob Edenbach and Jay Miles who showed
that they will be a force to be reckoned with in the future. Andy Crocker
sailing with Ryan Cox missed the first two races due to a breakdown and did not
have a chance to be in it. Race 1 was won by Tyler and new 505 sailor Andy
Wright as many were still getting used to the conditions. Nick Trotman and
crazy crew Mike Mills won second race with great boathandling on the last
downwind leg to take the lead. Race 3 was won by Tom Kivney and Tom Russell
while Nick/Mike took the last race to win the series by 1/4 of a point.
Railrider donated the trophies for the top three.
