1995 West Coast Midwinters: Alamitos Bay YC

by Earnest Hemmingway....... NOT!

This regatt was fun because record high temperatures made it real hot
and sultry like.

This regatta was not fun becuase it had just rained for a month and the
water was brown with swirls in it and it made me afraid to reach into
it. But I had to. I had to about six different times because we'd be
about to catch someone and all of a sudden they'd gradually start
walking away from us and we wouldn't know why. It was because of plastic
bags on our blades.

Of course, they were transparent bags, so they were invisible even from
the wire. So there was not way to know if the plastic bags were really
there or if the ram was just in a stupid position until you actually
reached your whole arm into the water to wipe the blade clean down to
the tip. Then it would trickle down inside your dry top.

Otherwise, the sailing was beautiful. Light to moderate, flat water,
strangely shifting.

Mike Martin and Nick Scandone walked away with it.

Anne and Kris Henderson missed the first race because they were
installing a new gasket on the new bottom of their boat. Kris took
a Sawsall to "skin window" over the winter and dropped 18 lbs. They
arrived in LA the night before the event without any fittings on their
deck. The paint still stunk. So they missed the first race. Then they
came out and got straight seconds to take second in the regatta,
counting a DNS. I guess the face lift helped.

The rest of us had good racing, too. ABYC ran a good show. And I am
ashamed for not providing Tank Talk with a good copy of the race
results. Sorry everybody.
