ABYC Memorial Day Regatta

1998-05-23 - 1998-05-24

Twelve teams from Vancouver to Southern California competed in the ABYC
Memorial Day Regatta on Saturday the 23rd and Sunday the 24th of May in Long
Beach California.  This was a multi-class event which is good exposure since we
were the biggest class. Matt and Bryan found out the drawbacks of multi-class
events  when rounding the leeward mark in 2nd place in race 1, some Idiot in a
Nacra cat ran them down from behind and put a huge hole in the back quarter of
the boat. They had to be towed in before the boat sank. (and Cat sailors wonder
why they have a bad name)  For everyone else the conditions were marginal
trapezing on Saturday and full trapezing on Sunday. Mike and Howard sailed well
with good speed to win almost every race. The only person to ruin their perfect
record was Andy Beckman and J.D. Hess.  Andy was planning on sailing with Bruce
Tilley but Bruce got sick on Friday and told Andy that he could not make it.
Andy tracked down a boat and crew  at the last minute and made it out to the
races and sailed smart and fast  to win race 6. The racing was very tight with
overlaps at every mark and lots of positions changing on every leg. Other
highlights included the return of Don Smith making a guest appearance with
Bruce Edwards, and Pete Melvin crewing for Howard in race 3 while Mike was
taking a test spin on Pete's new A-Cat and did not make it back in time for the
start. The next event in the ranking system is St. Francis on June 27,28. See
you all there.
