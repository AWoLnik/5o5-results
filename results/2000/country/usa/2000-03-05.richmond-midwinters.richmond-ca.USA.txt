Richmond Midwinter #4 Report:

4 5o5s raced Sunday in the last Richmond Midwinter racing day of the series. This was the largest turnout for the winter with Doug/Kirk in their teal Rondar, Ward/Merrilyn in their practice partially wood 5o5, Grant/Ian a team from South Africa just getting into the fleet here, and Dan/Kristin in their Kyrwood.
The forecast in the clubhouse was for NW winds 15-30 knots. The warning from the race committee handling dinghys races of El Toros, Lasers, Europes, I-14s, Wabbits, etc. at the skippers meeting was, "We'll get you off the course before you're blown off." The wind never did fill completely. We had at most 7 knots on the course coming from the NW.

We completed one race which was windward, reach, reach, windward. The tricky shifting breeze on the 1st leg kept all the boats searching for wind lines and looking for a header to tack on. Dan/Kristin rounded first with Grant/Ian and Doug/Kirk following. The first reach was pretty broad so it was a trade-off of sailing higher for more speed and overstanding or sailing low towards the mark and laying. The lead two boats went out for more breeze on the right and this paid off. Dan/Kristin gybed a little late and the S. Africans closed the to 4 BL. The next reach was close with poles on the headstays. No lead changes here. The beat to the finish was met with a dying breeze and current taking us to the finish. All the 505s finished before the wind completely died for 30 minutes. The RC called off the rest of the races for the day.
