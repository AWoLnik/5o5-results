I will never forget the scene. Opposing teams toe to toe in grim determination eyeballing each other with a tenacious contempt; no one wanted to be the first to blink. The starting signal’s echo was barely gone when the din of the race began. Men strained against the forces of fluid flow; fists clenched; veins bulged. The duel of the young bucks’ youthful energy and raw talent versus the grizzled vet’s decades of experience had begun: a spectacle of testosterone and beer, of crushed aluminum cans and matching forehead indentations. When the spray had settled the victors were crowned, and the losers suffered an ignominious defeat.

So went the parking lot beer can relay races conducted during day two of the now notoriously windless 2000 505 Midwinter regatta hosted by the SPYC in Saint Petersburg, Florida. Without the dampening effect of a full day of high wind racing this group of 505 sailors went unstable faster than a nuclear reactor with the control rods suddenly pulled out. Our sole female competitor and potentially calming influence, Lauren Abramson, had wisely elected to vacate the premises several hours prior, leaving the sailors with no alternative.

This regatta had all the ingredients for success: an able and willing race committee; a familiar and welcoming host club; great facilities; and sixteen well sailed 505s. The race committee performed well under these particularly trying circumstances - and called the wind perfectly. But the breeze never really materialized making this a bit of a non event. Scores with commentary follow:

1 8643 Barney Harris & Jesse Falsone 2, 3, 2 - 7

TEAM SPOT leveraged a lack of a hangover into the top position for this event for the second year in a row. This is not to be misconstrued as being against hangovers. Jesse [third child on the way] says he likes racing 505s because its an activity he can enjoy which will not result in any more kids.

2 8012 Henry Amthor & Douglas Amthor 5, 2, 4 - 11

With good boat speed and consistent tactics, the Amthors were in the hunt on every race. Henry carries the torch for all of us soon to be over the hill sailors, simply put: he was the last one standing. It took BOTH Doug and I to get him to cross the street without getting run over by a truck. An impressive display of aptitude tempered by the wisdom of years.

3 7093 Ethan Bixby & Scott Ikle 1, 6, 5 - 12

Ever gracious and hospitable, Ethan put up 7 at his house and arranged housing for many others including the Amthors and myself. Thank you again. Ethan and Scott’s performance was somewhat hindered by Ali’s Whomper in the top reach of race #3 - and Scott’s bachelor party the evening prior.

4 8722 Macy Nelson & Peter Alarie 4, 7, 3 - 14

Macy and Peter managed to hold up both ends of the parking lot beer can race spectrum: Macy abstaining completely and Peter leading the charge.

5 8734 Alexander Meller & Larry Tutle 7, 8, 1 - 16

Ali used his new larger spinnaker during Race #3, with the prior consent of all competitors. As expected, he was a bit faster reaching and much faster downwind and easily won the final race in a come from behind down wind finish. Larry Tuttle, builder of Waterat 505s, made a special guest celebrity "rock star" appearance as Ali’s crew. During the hours of postponement, Larry patiently discussed boat repair and rigging and signed autographs with a seemingly never ending stream of unworthy 505 groupies, myself included.

6 8631 Ryan Cox & Carl Smit 8, 4, 6 - 18

Clearly dominated the early beer can race. Demonstrated how to eviscerate a can of bud in 2.4 seconds flat. Also put their SEAL training to good use finding Witold's glasses on the bottom of the launching area (near where Witold dropped them).

7 8627 Tim Collins Bill Smith 3, 5, 14/DNC - 22

Weighed in heavily at first, but flamed out early. These two were totally intimidated by Henry Amthor’s Saturday evening performance and flinched at a critical moment, and elected to not compete on the final race day. We will be looking for an improved performance from these two following Bill’s return from his second undergrad collegiate experience.

8 8263 Ramsey Key & Mike Welch 12, 1, 14/DNC - 27

Both relatively new to the 505 class - after winning Race 2 in a borrowed boat we hope to see them both out in the future.
	
Dinghy Park	More dinghy park
9 7068 Ted Ferrarone & J.B. Ferrarone 11, 13, 7 - 31

Ted and JB broke in their new (used) Hamlin at this event, a nice looking boat. Saturday evening was Ted’s 505 bachelor party. Too bad he won’t get to use the new boat after he gets married.

Dinghy Park
10 7198 Hugh Morrin & Witold Gesing 6, 12, 14/DNC - 32

Hugh and Witold made a long trek with family in tow. Or was the boat in tow? Great to see them all down. Hopefully we will have more wind next year.

11 8085 Rene de La Rie & Allen Freedman 9, 10, 14/DNC - 33

Still, clearly the most cultured. Elected to attend a poetry recital instead of sailing the final race.

12 8735 Dustin Romey & Todd Lochner 16, 11, 8 - 35

First competitive event for Dustin and Todd in the brand new KISS [Keep it Simple, Sh*thead] Rondar. Dustin and Henry get double points for driving an over heating SPOT with 4 boats in tow both ways. Yow!

13 720 Chad Atkins & Chuck Norris 14, 9, 14/DNC - 37

I last saw Chuck asleep in the bar on Saturday night… Chad’s boat looks like someone had thrown it off of a car at 60 mph [seriously, the previous owner had his roof racks-with-boat-tied-on separate from the car]. Nothing a $25,000.00 check to Larry won’t fix.

14 7346 John Hauser & Steve Lieberman 13, 15, 10 - 38

A last minute combination which we were glad to see.

15 6987 Lauren Abramson & Bryan Jones 10, 14, 14/DNC - 38

Lauren's boat gets better looking every day.

16 7148 Peter Mignerey & Peter Epstein 15, 16, 9 - 40

Great to see the Peter M. back on the water after an extended period of other pursuits. Peter E. made the trek from Toronto for this event.

Several 505ers showed up even though they could not get boats to the event and could not get crewing/driving jobs. Bailey White and Paul von Grey both managed to get out on the water for a few hours on Saturday. Paul Muus would have raced his brand new Waterat, but broke his toe badly days before the event.
