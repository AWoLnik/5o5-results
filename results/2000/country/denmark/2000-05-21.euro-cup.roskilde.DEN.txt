Scandinavian Championship & Europa Cup, Roskilde, Denmark, 19/20/21 May

Tom Bojland reports from Denmark:

6 races was sailed in al kind of conditions, from 5 knots to 25, sun and
rain etc, all wery exciting and Schonherr/Friis won in close combat
with Rosen/Wenrup and Moller/Bojsen Moller.

Roskilde Sailing Club made an excellent event with free breakfast,
lunch and dinner all days, even a motorboat with free beer to the
crews after they passed the finishing line was provided. Many clubs
can learn something here!!!!!

Sadly the Germans decided to stay home, and missed and great event and
some great racing, actually a bit disappointing for us Danes and the
Swedes as well, because we often move more than 50% of our active
fleet to Germany to make some great racing there and support the
German class.

We certainly look forward to go back to Roskilde one day, those folks
know how to make a good event.
