Europa cup, Kiel Week, Germany, 17-20 June 2000

Further to the results given in the last circular, here is the report:

A fleet of forty four 505s from Germany, Denmark and Britain competed
for the Europa Cup event which is part of Kiel Week. There are five
Europa Cup events held throughout the season with the best three
results counting for a competitor's overall position.

The German 505 fleet is thriving with young sailors from the 470 and
420 classes. Not only is the class on the increase but the standard
is also rising. The racing was held on one of the outside
courses which meant good winds away from the immediate influence
of the land, although it meant a long sail to the start. The
local team of Wolfgang Hunger and Holger Jess dominated the
light air series with Hunger winning his 13th Kiel Week.
Incidentally, he also has two 470 world championships to his
credit.

Five races were held with Hunger and Jess winning four of them.
The other race was one by Stefan Bohm crewed by Gerald Roos.
Bohm also comes from the 470 class.
