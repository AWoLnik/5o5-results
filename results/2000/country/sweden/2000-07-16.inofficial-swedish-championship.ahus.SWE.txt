Inofficial Swedish Championship 2000

2000-07-14 - 2000-07-16

Organisor: Johan Arvedson & Swedish 505 Association

Class: 505

The inofficial Swedish nationals were held over a long weekend of
training and racing and the whole arrangement, on the water as well as
the social events was perfect. On behalf of all participants, I want to
give a big Thank You to Johan Arvedson and his team from the sailing
club in ÅHUS who did a super job setting the courses for us. Johan and
Anna did an enormous achievement and generously offered their house as
a central base camp where many of us also were accomodated., including
a very nice barbecue on Saturday evening.

Two teams from Denmark took the opportunity to come over and race with
us Swedes and despite the small fleet we had very close and fun racing.
The course was set close to land and a large group of spectators could
be seen everyday on the beach at the Conferance Hotel ÅhusStrand. The
wind was light to moderate and the sun was shining most of the time. We
got 9 races all together.

The traditional fotball game between crews and helmsmans on Friday
evening was a tough fight and ended 4-2, with an unlikely victory for
the crews.

The following headline & article is from the local daily magazine North
