1996 St. Francis Spring Dinghy

The Spring Dinghy is usally a great way to dust off the boat and get back into
the "swing" of things, and this event was no exception. The two-day event had
six races and one throw-out, and was sailed in 8-15 kt. breezes on the
Cityfront.

Twelve boats showed up on the line, and in nail-biting fashion, the top three
places in the regatta were decided by exactly one point. Howard Hamlin, sailing
with Rick Rattray, demonstrated his championship form and won the regatta with
scores of 3-3-(9)-3-.75-3, for a total of 12.75 points. Jeff Miller and Bruce
Heckman were very consistent, but were edged out at the end, despite beating
Howard in 4 out of 6 races. Their scores were 5-2-2-2-(6)-2 for a total of 13
points. Pete Melvin and Mike Martin won the final race, but it wasn't enough to
catch the leader, and they finished third with scores of 2-4-4-(6)-3-.75 for a
total of 13.75 points. WOW! Talk about close! Wondoleck/Kuncl and
Hackworth/Stahnke rounded out the top five.
