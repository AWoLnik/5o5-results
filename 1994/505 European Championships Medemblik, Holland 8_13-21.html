			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Mike Martin and I were leading overall after three
    races, but suffered a setback when we had to retire at the start of the 5th race after
    fouling the gate vessel in heavy starting traffic. In a gate start, standard for the 505
    class, any contact with gate boat results in a DSQ. Sitting out this medium air race, we
    had to watch all the top boats have a good race and improve their scores. Laying 5th
    overall going into the last race, we finished 3rd in the race, good enough to give us 3rd
    in the regatta.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">The 1990 World Champions Jorgen Schonherr and
    Anders Kaempe of Denmark came on strong in the last few races to win the 1994 European
    Championships. Paul Towers and Dan Johnson of Great Britain finished second by consistent
    sailing in the widely varying conditions in spite of having to drop a DNF when they broke
    their centerboard in the heavy air fourth race.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">1993 World Champions Ian Barker and Ian Mitchell
    of the U.K. were one of 3 boats that could win going into the last race, but a 10th in
    that race dropped them to 4th overall.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Four time World Champion Krister Bergstrom of
    Sweden, sailing with Thomas Moss, also had a chance at winning going into the last day,
    but they sailed their drop (16th) in the last race giving them 5th overall.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">It is interesting how the popularity and
    competitiveness of the 505 class increases each year. It is not uncommon in Great Britain,
    Germany or France to have 100 boat regattas. With this popularity comes greater depth in
    the fleet. As Jorgen Schonherr said &quot;each &quot; year I learn more and get faster and
    yet, it does not get any easier to win&quot;. an example of &quot; increased
    competitiveness is in high wind sailing. In what might be termed survival conditions for
    most classes, the 505's are having serious tactical racing. For example, in race 4 after
    two hours of high speed racing in 25 to 30 knots, the first 4 boats were overlapped at the
    finish.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Sailing in the Europeans, which are sailed only
    during the years when the World's are out of Europe, is just like a world championship
    except it takes only 1 week and there were no Australians or other American.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Holland is a beautiful, flat country of lush green
    farmland, dikes, windmills, tulips, dairy cows and pastures. One third of the country has
    been &quot;reclaimed from the &quot; sea&quot; over the &quot; last 400 years and is
    typically 3 to 5 meters below sea level.</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font size="4">Medemblik is a wonderful place to sail with the
    small harbor immediately adjacent to the boat course. The shallow water, 3 to 4 meters,
    makes for some short steep shop, and an easy place to break your mast I you put the tip in
    the mud. The village is a classic 400 plus year old sea port with leaning buildings,
    dikes, canals, locks, narrow streets, restaurants, cages, and with everything in walking
    distance. In short, it's a great place to sail.</font></p>
