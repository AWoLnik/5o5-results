International 505 Europa Cup, Riva del Garda, Italy (7-9 May 2010)

8 races sailed, all in 16+ knot winds. 58 entries from 9 nations, including
far-flung Denmark, Finland and Ireland, and Croatia from the east, and furthest
of all Mike Holt and Carl Smit from USA.

The regatta was won by GER 8875 Jens Findel and Johannes Tellen. First British
boat GBR 9032 was 5th sailed by Ian Pinnell and Ian Mitchell, just beating on
tiebreak the Irish IRL 8961 sailed by Ewan Barry and Charles Dwyer.

The weather was not brilliant but the sailing was fantastic. This accounts for
the British 6 boat trailer being fully booked for next year's Europa Cup at
Riva in May 2011 and the European Championship at Malcesine further down Lake
Garda in September 2011. Comments from regular 505 sailors Roger Deane and
Dennis Carwright sailing at Riva for the first time was that this was the best
sailing they had ever had.

Fourteen years ago a famous yachting correspondent wrote that the 505 was a 40
year old boat going nowhere; how wrong he was.
