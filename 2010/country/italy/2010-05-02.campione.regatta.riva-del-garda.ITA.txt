The weekend before Riva a regatta was held at Campione further down Lake
Garda. Three British boats took part. 3 races were held on the Saturday
in a good breeze, comprehensively won by GBR 9006 sailed by Terry
Scutcher and Christian Diebitsch. Unfortunately Sunday was a day of
unusual flat calm and there was no racing. Campione is a very pleasant
place and the club were very welcoming.
