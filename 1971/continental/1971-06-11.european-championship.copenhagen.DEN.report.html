        <h1>505 Europeans 1971</h1>
        <h5>Report by Mike Nott</h5>
        <p>The 505 European championship was held 
        at Copenhagen this year under the burgee of the Skovshoved Yacht Club. 
        The 505s from each of the eight countries, with the exception of Morocco, 
        had previously qualified to represent their countries, the number of 
        entrants being limited to 75, although this was later increased to 83. 
        An Olympic course was set, the total length of the course, without 
        allowance for tacking was approximately 10 nautical miles. This included 
        three windward legs.</p>
        <p>In the absence of Larry Marks, it was 
        expected that Hugh Bourn and Paul Deschamps would do well. Bourn now 
        works with Keith Musto, and has spent much time and thought to ensure 
        that the spars and sails for his 505 add up to a precisely tuned boat. 
        This he succeeded in doing, and carried off the Championship with a 
        first, two fourths and a fifth. His superior boat speed was always 
        apparent.</p>
        <p>The week was characterised by light, 
        variable winds, Force 0-2, due to anti cyclonic conditions producing 
        cloudless skies every day and a burning sun. On occasions, the wind 
        force increased, but the prevailing wind was invariably shifting up to 
        90 degrees, and made the beats very much a lottery. The commodore of the 
        club, Erik Aagaard, had considerable difficulty laying the course; on 
        Wednesday, after four hours of attempt he gave up and the racing was 
        cancelled. It should be added however that the line discipline of the 
        505 fleet was not good. The high number of general recalls testifies to 
        this, although the topless attractions on a nearby beach provided 
        adequate entertainment between starts. The standard of racing was high. 
        The English boats did well to secure five of the first ten places. They 
        showed a high level of consistency in foreign conditions, which only the 
        French could match – Serge Guillaume was second overall and Marc Bouet 
        fifth.</p>
        <p>The Bath brothers (Sweden) were 
        involved in an interesting incident following the first race, in which 
        John Donnelly crewed by Martin Auger had crossed the line first. The 
        Baths protested the race on the grounds that the starting gun had been 
        fired five seconds too early. The race committee admitted their error, 
        accepted the protest, and declared the race null and void. They have, 
        however, appealed to the Danish Yachting Association, and thence, 
        perhaps, to the IYRU but this means that the results must be considered 
        provisional for the time being. It may be though that the Bath brothers 
        stand to improve their overall position if their protest had not been 
        allowed.</p>
        <p><i>The IYRU later revoked the decision 
            of the race committee, thus giving the championship title to the Bath 
            brothers – evaluating many years of top results, a well deserved win but 
            nevertheless a true miscarriage of justice! (webmasters remark)</i></p>
        <p>The first race was won by Hugh Bourn, 
        closely followed by the Bath brothers and Mike Derry with David 
        Gallimore crewing for him. Bourn and Bath had established a good lead by 
        the final windward leg, but by good judgement of wind shifts, Mike Derry 
        closed the gap to 20 yards at the finish.</p>
        <p>Throughout the week there was always 
        an argument for doing a windward leg, especially inshore, in two tacks, 
        but the 505 helmsmen needed the courage of their convictions to do it. 
        Mike Derry was noticeably proficient on tactics throughout the meeting, 
        and often recovered from a middle of the fleet position by taking a 
        flyer over to one side of the course. In particular he gained many 
        places by constantly tacking to extreme positions downwind. Additionally, 
        Derry's speed through the water increased noticeably as the week went 
        by. This is his first year in 505s and bh has already made a 
        considerable mark in the class. </p>
        <p>The second, third and fourth races 
        were all characterised by light, variable winds with cloudless skies. In 
        the second race, Daniel Jounay's 'Camelion' (Peter Bainbridge's 'Camelion' 
        which won La Rochelle week this year) was very fast through the water, 
        but he was constantly being challenged by the only Moroccan boat, sailed 
        by Pierre and Susanne Tepley. The Tepleys sailed inshore on the first 
        beat, out to sea on the second and inshore again on the final leg, but 
        took second position to 'Camelion' in the end. </p>
        <p>The beat and first reach of the third 
        race took two frustrating hours to complete. Four boats took a 
        commanding lead and left the rest of the fleet behind. Gordon and Phil 
        Wilson in 'Frère Bear' read the wind conditions best to win this race 
        although the other three – Alfred Wait (Switzerland), the Quehen 
        brothers (France) and the Moroccan – were always challengers. Hugh Bourn 
        was subsequently able to discard his 57th in this race.</p>
        <p>The fourth and fifth races were sailed 
        in freshening, but still variable, winds. Two French boats won the 
        fourth race, Serge Guillaume in 'Miss France' and Marc Bouet in 'NN', 
        Hugh Bourn taking a fourth place. Clear wind on the start was always 
        important, although Mike Derry, who won the last race, gained most of 
        his positions by tacking well downwind, with good spinnaker work from 
        his crew. </p>
        <p>The majority of the boats were built 
        by Parkers, including Hugh Bourn's 'Salacious Sam'. Not unnaturally he 
        bad a suit of Musto sails, but otherwise a very simple layout with a 
        centre mainsheet. Rondar had a fair representation of boats from most of 
        the countries participating. </p>
        <p>The Scandinavian competitors favoured 
        Elvström and Anderson sails and Elvström spars, but the great majority 
        of helmsmen used Proctor spars. There were very few innovations in the 
        fittings line, the most interesting being a stem sheeted boom on two 
        Swedish boats. The U-shaped horse from the floor of the boat permitted 
        the boom to find its natural level above the transom, the kicking strap 
        taking all the strain on the boom. The layouts and interior designs of 
        the English boats were less complicated than those of other countries, 
        although Gordon Wilson's 'Frère Bear' had been beautifully thought out 
        to a very complicated specification.</p>
