      <p align="justify"><font size="4">The 505 European championship was held 
		at Copenhagen this year under the burgee of the Skovshoved Yacht Club. 
		The 505s from each of the eight countries, with the exception of Morocco, 
		had previously qualified to represent their countries, the number of 
		entrants being limited to 75, although this was later increased to 83. 
		An Olympic course was set, the total length of the course, without 
		allowance for tacking was approximately 10 nautical miles. This included 
		three windward legs.</font></p>

		<p align="justify"><font size="4">In the absence of Larry Marks, it was 
		expected that Hugh Bourn and Paul Deschamps would do well. Bourn now 
		works with Keith Musto, and has spent much time and thought to ensure 
		that the spars and sails for his 505 add up to a precisely tuned boat. 
		This he succeeded in doing, and carried off the Championship with a 
		first, two fourths and a fifth. His superior boat speed was always 
		apparent.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">The week was characterised by light, 
		variable winds, Force 0-2, due to anti cyclonic conditions producing 
		cloudless skies every day and a burning sun. On occasions, the wind 
		force increased, but the prevailing wind was invariably shifting up to 
		90 degrees, and made the beats very much a lottery. The commodore of the 
		club, Erik Aagaard, had considerable difficulty laying the course; on 
		Wednesday, after four hours of attempt he gave up and the racing was 
		cancelled. It should be added however that the line discipline of the 
		505 fleet was not good. The high number of general recalls testifies to 
		this, although the topless attractions on a nearby beach provided 
		adequate entertainment between starts. The standard of racing was high. 
		The English boats did well to secure five of the first ten places. They 
		showed a high level of consistency in foreign conditions, which only the 
		French could match – Serge Guillaume was second overall and Marc Bouet 
		fifth.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">The Bath brothers (Sweden) were 
		involved in an interesting incident following the first race, in which 
		John Donnelly crewed by Martin Auger had crossed the line first. The 
		Baths protested the race on the grounds that the starting gun had been 
		fired five seconds too early. The race committee admitted their error, 
		accepted the protest, and declared the race null and void. They have, 
		however, appealed to the Danish Yachting Association, and thence, 
		perhaps, to the IYRU but this means that the results must be considered 
		provisional for the time being. It may be though that the Bath brothers 
		stand to improve their overall position if their protest had not been 
		allowed.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><i><font size="4">The IYRU later revoked the decision 
		of the race committee, thus giving the championship title to the Bath 
		brothers – evaluating many years of top results, a well deserved win but 
		nevertheless a true miscarriage of justice! (webmasters remark)</font></i></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">The first race was won by Hugh Bourn, 
		closely followed by the Bath brothers and Mike Derry with David 
		Gallimore crewing for him. Bourn and Bath had established a good lead by 
		the final windward leg, but by good judgement of wind shifts, Mike Derry 
		closed the gap to 20 yards at the finish.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">Throughout the week there was always 
		an argument for doing a windward leg, especially inshore, in two tacks, 
		but the 505 helmsmen needed the courage of their convictions to do it. 
		Mike Derry was noticeably proficient on tactics throughout the meeting, 
		and often recovered from a middle of the fleet position by taking a 
		flyer over to one side of the course. In particular he gained many 
		places by constantly tacking to extreme positions downwind. Additionally, 
		Derry's speed through the water increased noticeably as the week went 
		by. This is his first year in 505s and bh has already made a 
		considerable mark in the class. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">The second, third and fourth races 
		were all characterised by light, variable winds with cloudless skies. In 
		the second race, Daniel Jounay's 'Camelion' (Peter Bainbridge's 'Camelion' 
		which won La Rochelle week this year) was very fast through the water, 
		but he was constantly being challenged by the only Moroccan boat, sailed 
		by Pierre and Susanne Tepley. The Tepleys sailed inshore on the first 
		beat, out to sea on the second and inshore again on the final leg, but 
		took second position to 'Camelion' in the end. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">The beat and first reach of the third 
		race took two frustrating hours to complete. Four boats took a 
		commanding lead and left the rest of the fleet behind. Gordon and Phil 
		Wilson in 'Frère Bear' read the wind conditions best to win this race 
		although the other three – Alfred Wait (Switzerland), the Quehen 
		brothers (France) and the Moroccan – were always challengers. Hugh Bourn 
		was subsequently able to discard his 57th in this race.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">The fourth and fifth races were sailed 
		in freshening, but still variable, winds. Two French boats won the 
		fourth race, Serge Guillaume in 'Miss France' and Marc Bouet in 'NN', 
		Hugh Bourn taking a fourth place. Clear wind on the start was always 
		important, although Mike Derry, who won the last race, gained most of 
		his positions by tacking well downwind, with good spinnaker work from 
		his crew. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">The majority of the boats were built 
		by Parkers, including Hugh Bourn's 'Salacious Sam'. Not unnaturally he 
		bad a suit of Musto sails, but otherwise a very simple layout with a 
		centre mainsheet. Rondar had a fair representation of boats from most of 
		the countries participating. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">The Scandinavian competitors favoured 
		Elvström and Anderson sails and Elvström spars, but the great majority 
		of helmsmen used Proctor spars. There were very few innovations in the 
		fittings line, the most interesting being a stem sheeted boom on two 
		Swedish boats. The U-shaped horse from the floor of the boat permitted 
		the boom to find its natural level above the transom, the kicking strap 
		taking all the strain on the boom. The layouts and interior designs of 
		the English boats were less complicated than those of other countries, 
		although Gordon Wilson's 'Frère Bear' had been beautifully thought out 
		to a very complicated specification.</font></p>
