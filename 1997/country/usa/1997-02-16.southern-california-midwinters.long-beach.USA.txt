5o5 Southern California Midwinters

On Feb. 15,16 we held the Southern California Midwinter regatta at Alamitos Bay
Yacht Club in Long Beach CA. We had a small but extremely competitive fleet of
10 boats. The weather was shitty. Although warm, it was cloudy and very light
breeze both days. Total trap time was about 30 seconds. Mike & Howie toped the
fleet with four 1st and a 2nd. Bruce Heckman & Jeff Miller finished on their
heals in second. Third overall went to rising stars Uli Coblenz and Dan
Thompson. Other competitors of interest were Olympic Laser sailor Nick Adamson
sailing with Bruce Tilly, and "Team Transplant" Mike Smith of East Coast fame
sailing with Johan Backjin who just relocated to Sacramento from Sweden.

Racing was tight and light. the series started in about 1 knot of breeze for
the first race. Urs Rothacher from Switzerland took a early lead only to be
passed by Bruce Heckman & Jeff Miller at the top mark. Jeff went on to win the
race. Subsequent races were in 5 to 8 knot light conditions. Bruce and Jeff
usually took an early lead but Mike and Howie were able to pass to take honors
at the finish line. An indication of the quality of the fleet is shown by the
Results of Dave Shelton & Bruce Edwards finishing DFL. This Team has finished
in the top 5 at the worlds several times. Pretty Stacked Fleet Eh?
