Region I 505 Regatta at New Bedford Yacht Club, South Dartmouth MA. Aug. 16-17.

By Tom Kivney

The racing was on Buzzards Bay. There were 3 races Sat. One Worlds course and 2
Olympic courses. It was great racing with winds around 15 puffs to 18. The
courses were great with tight reaches and 0.8 mile weather legs. We used gate
starts and 15 boats raced. Saturday everyone adjourned to the parking lot for
some Red Dog.

Sunday we raced 2 Olympic courses. The first race was raced in 8-10 and the
wind filled in to 15 for the second race. We had everyone off the water and on
his or her way home by 3:30 PM. Many thanks to the New Bedford Yacht Club for a
great Regatta. Neal Fowler organized another perfect event in true Fowler
style. 11 AM harbor start Saturday & 10 AM Harbor Start Sunday. No waiting
around, just great racing and a lot of fun. Thanks again, Neal.
