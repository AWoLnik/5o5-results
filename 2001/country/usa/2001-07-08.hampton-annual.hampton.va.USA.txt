Hampton Annual 2001
by Henry Amthor

Hampton Yacht Club (according to Henry, the Chesapeake Bay's heavy air sailing
capital) served up another windy event .. Barney Harris & Clayton James sailed
strong on Saturday in 8-12 knots with 3 bullets and hung on Sunday in 15 to 26
knots to hold off Ali Meller/Steve Sparkman for the regatta win. Teamspot had a
spectacular wipe out in race 4 when their rudder fell off on a three sail
reach, giving the race to Tyler Moore/Richard Winters. Later in race 5 they
broke their boom on the second beat giving the race to the Amthors but not
allowing Meller/Sparkman to get by for the regatta win. Congrats to Barney &
Clayton for their win and tenacity in sailing the final two legs with a broken
boom to win the tie breaker over Ali & Steve... Ali/Steve had their own
challenges, as a broken twing cleat prevented them from flying the kite on
starboard tack in the last race.

A few other recollections: Tyler "Wild Thing" Moore/Richard Winters trying to
do the wild thing on the runs in under 12 knots on Saturday; Tyler claimed he
knew it was slow, but it was way more fun. Henry Amthor getting the crew
substition just right, racing with wife Barb in Saturday's lighter breezes and
Doug "I gotta kitchen pass from Sarah!" Amthor in Sunday's breeze. Another
"creek crawl" which included crashing someone's birthday party.
