		<p align="justify"><font size="4">Dun Laoghaire, the
    mail boat terminal and yachting harbour in Dublin Bay, was the venue for the 505 European
    championship from August 15th to 23rd. Once again Britain's Derek Farrant was a convincing
    winner, this time with his new man Mike Fountain on the wire.</font></p>

    height="339" hspace="8"></font><font size="4">The third week of August was characterised
    by fast moving fronts bringing boisterous but changeable winds and everything from bright
    sun to torrential rain. Farrant stamped his authority on the fleet in all conditions,
    although be was pushed hard in the heavier going by the eventual runner-up Jan Eppers, the
    Danish champion, and the Bath brothers, for some time top dogs in Sweden.
		<br><br>The field was a representative and star studded one with the cream of Europe supplemented
    by entries from as far afield as Hong Kong and the Argentine. Unfortunately the
    international team racing scheduled for the Wednesday was blown off and is now to be
    sailed in Paris in October but the day to day races' showed a tendency for different
    nations to prosper in certain conditions. <br></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">The championship was off to an inauspicious
    start in a fluky Force 1-2 breeze. After an hour's postponement to allow the wind to
    settle in the SE the 65 entries embarked on an uptide beat with Farrant in 'Miss VII'
    quickly leading the shoreward contingent and crossing back to the middle in time to cover
    any lifts.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">At the first mark it was Farrant well clear of the Argentinian Hector Domato in
    a borrowed boat, using his own sails, and Hugh Bourn of Britain. Throughout the race the
    wind increased and Farrant looked more and more assured of success. Demato hung on grimly
    despite Farrant's cautious covering and a battle royal was fought for third by three
    Hastings crews. Gordon Wilson in 'Frère's Bear' looked to have third in his pocket when
    only yards from the line he performed an aquatic evolution, letting through Paul and
    Victor Deschamps (GB) in 'Phantom' and Bourn. Eppers in 'Moustache' was sixth.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">If Sunday's wind was fluky, Monday's was
    impossible. After ten postponements, three relaid courses and a general recall a slow
    start was made in a light south-easterly. Farrant and several French boats led the port
    wing out to sea, Paul Nevard (GB) in 'Ducky Too' went well inshore out of the tide with, a
    local and British following. Many were confounded when a Force 3 sprang up from nowhere
    bringing both wings in on close reaches while the cautious middlemen were caught
    flatfooted. Pierre Poullain's 'Viking' was first round with a 200 yard lead from Nevard
    and Farrant.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">The fleet was slow to fly spinnakers until
    Nevard, having perfected his close reaching drill in FDs, hoisted. The effect was dramatic 
			– 'Ducky Too' left 'Miss.Vll' and screamed off in pursuit of Poullain. The Frenshman could
    not match Nevard's spinnaker skill on the second reach, dropping and rehoisting his
    spinnaker in an agony of indecision before Nevard went through to windward. Nevard lost on
    the beat, however, and first Poullain then Farrant got past.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">On the shuttle Nevard again
    gave a paralysing spinnaker performance and at the last mark it was any one of four to
    win, Jan Eppers having come up on the heat in the strengthening wind. Poullain had the
    advantage of a short lead and 'chose to cover Eppers and Farrant but this led them all
    through the dirty wind of the running fleet and let Nevard pull well up. Poullain crossed
    Nevard just in time to cover him while Eppers and Farrant tacked early for the finish in
    the hope of pinching home on a lift. Poullain took the gun from Nevard, Farrant, Eppers,
    N.Loday and P.Chaigne of France in 'Dead or Alive' and C. and P.Bath of Sweden in
    'Kalabalik'. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">Although reasonable at launching time the wind came up to a squally Force 5 during the third race on Tuesday, conditions which
    really suited the Scandinavians. At the first mark, however, it was Poullain once again.
    British hopes were lessened by Farrant's seventh but he scooted downwind with superb
    spinnaker work and pulled through to second. As these two battled for the lead Eppers once
    more showed his windward ability in a blow and went away on his own while Roumaillac of
    France slipped into second.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">The wind increased and many of the
    tailenders swam down the shuttle as the leaders beat the other way. Roumaillac fell back a
    little in the gusts while the other heavy weather experts, the Bath brothers of Sweden
    stormed up to third from a poor position after an early morning dip. Eppers took the gun
    from Farrant. Poullain was fourth, Roumaillac and C.Brodard in 'Djinn' fifth and Loday
    sixth. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">Wednesday's sailing was blown off but at
    last a fairly settled Force 4 wind was blowing on Thursday morning. The committee made
    their only miscalculation of the week and laid a short line, but a fair one. With a strong
    tide setting the fleet up towards the first mark and no room for premature starters to
    free off down the line, the result was four general recalls.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">At last they were away and
    Farrant powered away from the committee boat end into a lead which be held to the first
    mark. Hugh Bourn almost flew along the reaches under spinnaker to race from fourth to
    first at the leeward mark. A wind shift biased the beat badly and allowed little place
    changing and Farrant had to bide his time. He tried every tactic on the run but could not
    get past and Bourn started the final beat with a narrow lead. A knot in the knitting
    slowed him momentarily and Farrant sailed through to another first and a firm overall
    lead. Harold Cudmore and C.Bruen in 'Overdrawn' (Ireland) were third, J.Danielou and
    J.Gillet (France) in 'Gentil Petit Virus d'amour' were fourth, the Pajot brothers (France)
    fifth in 'Leopard' and Poullain sixth.</font></p>

    SRC="../pix/5em-69b.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" width="336"
    height="466" hspace="8"></a>As it turned out the fifth race on Friday was to be the last race of the series as the bad
    weather deteriorated further by Saturday. A furious sea boiled outside the harbour and a
    good Force 5 blew, with an occasional line squall.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">The fleet was away first time and the
    Bath brothers went straight to the front, chased by Eppers, never to be headed. Farrant
    tried a port hitch for clear air and put himself the wrong side of the only major shift of
    the day to round the mark in the late teens. He did well to pull up to twelfth at the
    finish but with Bath and Eppers at the front his overall lead was threatened. 
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">Cudmore had
    also been coming up in the rough going and at one point almost caught Eppers at the lee
    mark by astute tacking downwind. However, he came in a shade too fine and flipped as he
    dropped his spinnaker. The Bath brothers held their lead from Eppers. P.Sadoc and
    A.Deviter (France) in 'Gibbies' were third, Cudmore fourth, the Pajot brothers fifth and
    Paul and Victor Deschamps sixth. Although he dropped in this race Farrant still retained
    his overall lead.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4"><strong>The results were </strong><br>
		<br>1. 'Miss VII' (Derek Farrant and Mike Fountain, GB) 11 points. <br>
		2. 'Moustache' (Jan Eppers and Per Gotfredsen. Denmark) 20,4 <br>3. 'Kalabalik' (Christer and Pelle Bath, Sweden) 30,4
		<br>4. 'Overdrawn' (Harold Cudmore and Chris Bruen, Ireland) 41,7 <br>5. 'Phantom' (Paul and Victor Deschamps, GB) 43,1
		<br>6. 'Samuel Esquire' (Hugh Bourn and Mike Bryant, GB) 44,0 <br>7. 'Leopard' (Yves and Marc Pajot. France) 49,0
		<br>8. 'Djinn' (Jean Roumaillac and Christian Brodard, France) 53,0 <br>
		9. 'Viking' (Pierre Poullain and Daniel Nottet, France) 61,7 <br><br>Farrant's win was a popular one and there is no doubt that he is as fast or faster than
    ever with Mike Fountain in place of brother Robin. The winning boat is one of the new
    wooden Parkers which have had mixed fortunes this year. In the hands of Mike Arnold
    another won the light weather British championship but this week was their first serious
    test in dusty conditions.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">Farrant showed a marked superiority to windward in a sea and
    held his own downwind. He is not convinced that the extra stiffness of the wooden hull
    outweighs the superior finish of a glass hull and says that his next boat will probably be
    a glass hull with wood tanks, the same combination used by, Christer and Pelle Bath. All
    the front runners were British Parker boats. <br><br>In contrast there was a variety of sails at the top, most helmsmen favouring their own
    national top sailmakers. Technical talking point of the week, was the introduction of
    spinnaker chutes, a move overwhelmingly voted in at the AGM on the Wednesday evening.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="4">There were reservations about the need to move the jib tack further back – to a proposed 
			new maximum of 4 cm – many feeling this will inhibit windward performance. Several boats
    with the officially allowed experimental chutes had, however, performed well in the week
    and in the past season of trials and presumably the problems can be ironed out by a slight
    change of jib cut and boat tune. <br><br>The National and Royal St. George Yacht Clubs are to be congratulated on their handling of
    this, their first major international event. The lines were true and the courses good,
    despite the elements, and information and public commentary was constantly available from
    the splendidly equipped mobile office of the sponsors, Player-Wills. </font>
