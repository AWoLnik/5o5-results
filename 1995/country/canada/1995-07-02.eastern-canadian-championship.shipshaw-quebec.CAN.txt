1995 Eastern Canadian Championships
The 1995 Eastern Canadian Championship was hosted by the Lac St. Jean
fleet, in Quebec. Despite being far enough north to sometimes see the
Northern Lights, this was not called the Northern Canadian Championship!
Jeff and Florence Boyd of Kingston were 1st, Hugh Morrin/Steve Yates of
Alberta and Kingston were 2nd, and Kevin Shulz/Phil Barron of Ottawa
3rd. Renka and Adam Gesing were 4th, and Chuck Hansen/Penny Estabrook
were 5th.

The event had good winds, and the social events turned into a birthday
party for Penny, who turned fifty!
