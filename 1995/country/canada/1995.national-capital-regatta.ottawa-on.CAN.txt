National Capital Regatta
Ottawa, Ontario

Saturday was clody and cool, but the winds were there (mostly between the
races) with 20-30 degree shifts in 14knot breezes, except where the puffs came
through and gave us 20-30knots. Jeff sailing well except having a bit of
difficulty with the second race (50 degree veer) that turned the top four
backwards.

Sunday we attempted race 5 but it started in light winds and went lighter and
the race was shortened to 3 legs which took over 1.5 hours and 4 boats could
not finish due to time limit. However the 6th race filled in and we had a
gentle 7 knots to finish the day.
